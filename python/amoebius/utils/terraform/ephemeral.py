amoebius/utils/terraform/ephemeral.py

Handles ephemeral usage for Terraform state in /dev/shm, relying on the generic
ephemeral_symlinks context manager from amoebius/utils/ephemeral_file.py for
symlinking 'tfstate' files to an actual Terraform working directory. Also
handles optional Vault-based encryption/decryption of state if a transit key
is provided.

We revert to for-loops for side effects to avoid mypy issues.

    Asynchronous context manager that, if ephemeral usage is desired, places
    the Terraform state files in a memory-based temporary directory (/dev/shm),
    symlinks them back to the 'terraform_dir', and optionally encrypts/decrypts
    the data via Vault transit if a 'transit_key_name' is set on the given storage.

    Steps:
      1) Create ephemeral directory in /dev/shm.
      2) Symlink ephemeral 'terraform.tfstate' and 'terraform.tfstate.backup'
         into the actual Terraform directory.
      3) If a Vault client and a 'transit_key_name' are present, decrypt
         the ciphertext from the storage backend into ephemeral memory.
      4) Yield control for Terraform commands (init, apply, destroy, show, etc.).
      5) If encryption was used, read updated data from ephemeral memory,
         re-encrypt it, and store it back in the backend.
      6) Cleanup ephemeral directory and symlinks on exit.

    Args:
        storage (StateStorage):
            The storage class that may hold ciphertext for Terraform state.
        vault_client (Optional[AsyncVaultClient]):
            A Vault client used for encryption/decryption if 'transit_key_name' is set.
        minio_client (Optional[Minio]):
            An optional Minio client for remote storage usage, if needed.
        terraform_dir (str):
            The directory containing Terraform configuration. We place symlinks in
            this directory for 'terraform.tfstate' and 'terraform.tfstate.backup'.

    Yields:
