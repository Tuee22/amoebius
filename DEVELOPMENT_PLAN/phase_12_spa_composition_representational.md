## Phase Status

📋 Planned. Specified before implementation; every sprint below is 📋 Planned and every prescriptive statement
is design intent, never a tested amoebius result. This phase opens after the Phase 11 boundary fake-tool gate
passes and runs on **no substrate** (`none`) across **Registers 1 and 2** — it stands up no host and no
cluster, only an in-process composition-decode battery (Register 1) and a locally-served demo SPA driven
against a faked backend (Register 2). Where a shape below is already exercised in a sibling system — the
`infernix` and `jitML` `web/` PureScript demo SPAs, their `purescript-bridge` contract generation, and the
prodbox pure/no-process suite — that is **sibling evidence, not an amoebius result**. This is the
**representational** half of SPA composition; the **live** SPA deploy behind Keycloak/Envoy on `linux-cpu`
stays [Phase 32](phase_32_spa_live_deploy.md).

## Phase Summary

This phase proves that amoebius's SPA composition is sound **at the spec/code layer** and that its rendered
frontend contract drives a real browser — both without any live infrastructure. It delivers the SPA app-spec
type (a multi-service surface whose dependencies are declared as **capability needs**, never products), the
composition of an ML-workflow demo fragment into that surface as **shared-library use** (a nested
infernix/jitML `.dhall`, which is application logic), the QuickCheck property `prop_spaCompositionDecodes`
establishing that an app spec + a demo fragment always compose into one well-typed value that decodes through
Gate 1 + Gate 2, and the lifted PureScript demo SPA whose contract types are **regenerated from the composed
Haskell ADTs via `purescript-bridge`** (a build artifact, never committed) and driven end to end against a
faked backend under Playwright. What is *not* here: the live deploy onto a cluster, the Keycloak/Envoy edge,
the typed reconciler applying manifests, and any inference on a real substrate — all of that is
[Phase 32](phase_32_spa_live_deploy.md). This phase front-loads exactly the parts of SPA composition that a
pure decode and a locally-served browser run can settle.

**Substrate:** none — no host, no cluster; the gate is an in-process `cabal test` composition battery
(Register 1) plus a locally-served demo SPA driven under Playwright against a faked backend (Register 2),
analogous to the Phase-11 boundary fake-tool harness. The inference/training substrate is structurally absent
from the SPA surface — it is a deployment rule bound only at [Phase 32](phase_32_spa_live_deploy.md).

**Register:** 1/2 — the single deliberate two-register gate: Register 1 (the composition property decodes) + Register 2 (the PureScript demo SPA against a faked backend), both in-process, no cluster (§K).

**Gate:** two in-process registers pass together — **(Register 1)** a multi-service app-spec fixture composes
with an infernix/jitML ML-workflow demo fragment into one well-typed Dhall value that decodes through Gate 1
(`dhall type`) + Gate 2 (the total decoder), `prop_spaCompositionDecodes` holds over generated app+fragment
pairs, and every ill-composed SPA fixture fails `dhall type` or decode-rejects; **(Register 2)** the lifted
PureScript demo SPA, its contract types regenerated from the composed Haskell ADTs via `purescript-bridge`
(never committed), runs locally against a faked backend and is driven end to end under Playwright — all on no
substrate, with the run emitting a proven/tested/assumed ledger that marks the live SPA deploy
([Phase 32](phase_32_spa_live_deploy.md)) UNVERIFIED.

## Doctrine adopted

- [`app_vs_deployment_doctrine.md §8 — Shared-library use is application logic`](../documents/engineering/app_vs_deployment_doctrine.md#8-shared-library-use-is-application-logic),
  with [`§2 — The application-logic surface`](../documents/engineering/app_vs_deployment_doctrine.md#2-the-application-logic-surface--what-an-app-is):
  the SPA composes an ML workflow by naming *that* it uses infernix (a chatbot) or jitML (an RL-gaming
  platform) — a nested `ExtensionSpec` `.dhall`, which is application logic; the app surface has no field for
  a replica count, a region, or an inference substrate, so the composition carries no placement vocabulary.
- [`service_capability_doctrine.md §2 — The capability set`](../documents/engineering/service_capability_doctrine.md#2-the-capability-set)
  and [`§7 — Expressing a capability in the DSL`](../documents/engineering/service_capability_doctrine.md#7-expressing-a-capability-in-the-dsl):
  the SPA's multi-service surface declares each dependency as a capability need drawn from the fixed no-product
  union — `ObjectStore` / `Sql` / `MessageBus` / `Identity` / `Edge` — never as a product literal.
- [`lift_and_compose_doctrine.md`](../documents/engineering/lift_and_compose_doctrine.md) §4 (the demo web
  apps as PureScript SPAs whose contracts are generated from the Haskell ADTs via `purescript-bridge`) and
  §2/§3 (the reuse map): amoebius **lifts** the infernix/jitML `web/` demo-SPA shells and **regenerates** their
  contracts from the amoebius-composed types — a demo web app is application logic that *uses* its extension,
  never itself an extension. That the sibling shells run today is **sibling evidence, not an amoebius result**.
- [`generated_artifacts_doctrine.md`](../documents/engineering/generated_artifacts_doctrine.md) §2/§3: the
  PureScript frontend contract is a build artifact emitted from the composed Haskell ADTs and **never
  committed**; only the Haskell source and the authored fixtures are versioned, and a Register-1 golden pins
  the emitted contract as a fixture of the *renderer's* behaviour.
- [`conformance_harness_doctrine.md`](../documents/engineering/conformance_harness_doctrine.md) §2/§3: the
  pre-cluster spine — **Register 1** explicitly includes the representational SPA composition and **Register 2**
  explicitly includes the demo SPAs run locally against a faked backend, driven end to end; rendering the
  composition and its contract never touches live infrastructure.
- [`testing_doctrine.md §2 — Three registers`](../documents/engineering/testing_doctrine.md#2-three-registers-of-amoebius-testing):
  this phase's gate reaches Registers 1 and 2 and emits a per-run proven/tested/assumed ledger whose acceptance
  token reads *spec-composition proven* / *tested (local browser)*, never *runtime proven*, with the live
  deploy marked UNVERIFIED (owned by [Phase 32](phase_32_spa_live_deploy.md)).
- [`dsl_doctrine.md §5 — the illegal-state-unrepresentable contract`](../documents/engineering/dsl_doctrine.md#5-the-illegal-state-unrepresentable-contract):
  the two typed gates — Gate 1 (Dhall typechecker) + Gate 2 (in-process `Dhall.inputFile auto` decoder) — that
  the composed SPA value passes; `prop_spaCompositionDecodes` establishes that composition preserves
  well-formedness so *if it composes, it decodes*.

## Sprints

## Sprint 12.1: The SPA app-spec type — a multi-service surface of capability needs 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `src/Amoebius/Spa/Spec.hs`, `dhall/amoebius/Spa.dhall`, `dhall/examples/spa_chatbot.dhall`
(target paths; not yet built)
**Blocked by**: Phase 4 (the Gate-1 Dhall schema + the no-product `Capability` union the surface draws from);
Phase 8 (the capability → provider → shape binder the SPA's needs resolve against)
**Independent Validation**: `dhall type` accepts `dhall/examples/spa_chatbot.dhall` against the SPA app-spec
type; a grep for `minio` / `keycloak` / `pulsar` / `patroni` / `postgres` on the SPA surface returns nothing;
a variant that names a product, or that adds a `replicas` / `region` / `substrate` field, fails Gate 1 because
the SPA surface has no such arm.
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/service_capability_doctrine.md`,
`documents/engineering/app_vs_deployment_doctrine.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system_components.md`

### Objective
Adopt [`service_capability_doctrine.md §2/§7`](../documents/engineering/service_capability_doctrine.md#2-the-capability-set)
and [`app_vs_deployment_doctrine.md §2`](../documents/engineering/app_vs_deployment_doctrine.md#2-the-application-logic-surface--what-an-app-is):
define the SPA app-spec type as an application-logic artifact whose multi-service surface composes capability
needs — buckets against `ObjectStore`, a database against `Sql`, topics against `MessageBus`, auth rules
against `Identity`, published UI against `Edge` — and never names a product or a deployment dial.

### Deliverables
- An `Amoebius.Spa.Spec` library defining the SPA app-spec type: a set of named UI/service surfaces plus the
  capability-need record each depends on, carrying the SPA's cluster-unique name and **no** deployment
  vocabulary (the type has nowhere to put `replicas`, `region`, `failover`, `chaos`, or `substrate`).
- A `dhall/amoebius/Spa.dhall` type the example SPAs decode against, composing the Phase-4 capability-need arms
  into one multi-service surface, with secrets referenced by name only (a typed `SecretRef`).
- A worked `dhall/examples/spa_chatbot.dhall` skeleton declaring an `ObjectStore` bucket set (`<app>/<bucket>`),
  a `Sql` need, `MessageBus` topics, an `Identity` auth rule, and an `Edge` publish — each against the
  capability arm, no provider or shape named.

### Validation
1. `dhall type` over the example SPA succeeds; every service dependency resolves to a capability arm and no
   product name appears on the SPA surface.
2. A variant naming `minio` directly fails Gate 1 (no product arm), and a variant adding a `replicas` field
   fails Gate 1 (no such field on the SPA surface).

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned).

## Sprint 12.2: Compose an ML-workflow demo fragment as shared-library use — `prop_spaCompositionDecodes` 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `src/Amoebius/Spa/Workflow.hs`, `dhall/examples/spa_chatbot.dhall` (uses infernix),
`dhall/examples/spa_rl_gaming.dhall` (uses jitML), `test/dsl/SpaCompositionSpec.hs` (target paths; not yet
built)
**Blocked by**: Sprint 12.1; Phase 5 (the total Gate-2 `Dhall.inputFile auto` decoder the composed value
decodes through); Phase 6 (the illegal-state corpus + QuickCheck harness the `prop_*` properties live in)
**Independent Validation**: `prop_spaCompositionDecodes` is green over generated app-spec + demo-fragment
pairs; each positive `dhall/examples/spa_compose_*.dhall` decodes through Gate 1 + Gate 2 with the library
`.dhall` nested inside the SPA spec; each ill-composed `illegal_spa_compose_*.dhall` fails at its tagged gate;
a grep of either SPA surface for `cuda` / `metal` / `linux-cpu` returns nothing.
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/app_vs_deployment_doctrine.md`,
`documents/engineering/lift_and_compose_doctrine.md`, `documents/engineering/testing_doctrine.md`

### Objective
Adopt [`app_vs_deployment_doctrine.md §8 — Shared-library use is application logic`](../documents/engineering/app_vs_deployment_doctrine.md#8-shared-library-use-is-application-logic):
compose an ML-workflow demo fragment into the SPA as a shared-library dependency — a chatbot via infernix, an
RL-gaming platform via jitML — declaring *that* the SPA uses it (the library `.dhall` nested inside the SPA
spec) while *where* the workflow runs stays structurally absent, and prove that the composition always yields
one decoding value.

### Deliverables
- An `Amoebius.Spa.Workflow` library and a workflow-composition field on the SPA spec that names a shared
  library (infernix or jitML) and nests its configuration `.dhall` into the SPA spec (the library call graph =
  application logic).
- The worked `dhall/examples/spa_chatbot.dhall` composing the infernix demo fragment and
  `dhall/examples/spa_rl_gaming.dhall` composing the jitML demo fragment — each naming *that* it uses the
  library, neither naming a substrate; plus `illegal_spa_compose_*` negatives (a fragment whose capability
  needs do not compose; a product literal smuggled onto the app surface).
- A `prop_spaCompositionDecodes` QuickCheck property (an app spec + an ML-workflow demo fragment always
  compose to a value that decodes through Gate 1 + Gate 2), labelled **TESTED (sampled)**.

### Validation
1. The positive `spa_compose_*` fixtures compose and decode (Gate 1 + Gate 2 green); each `illegal_spa_compose_*`
   fixture fails at its tagged gate; the suite is red if any ill-composed SPA decodes.
2. `prop_spaCompositionDecodes` is green — the representational composition is proven at the spec/code layer,
   with the live deploy left to [Phase 32](phase_32_spa_live_deploy.md).

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned).

## Sprint 12.3: `purescript-bridge` contract generation from the composed ADTs (never committed) 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `src/Amoebius/Spa/Contract.hs` (the `purescript-bridge` generator over the composed ADTs),
`web/` (the lifted infernix/jitML PureScript demo-SPA shells), `test/spa/ContractGoldenSpec.hs` (target paths;
not yet built). The emitted `*.purs` contract is a **generated artifact and is not committed**.
**Blocked by**: Sprint 12.2 (the composed Haskell app/workflow ADTs the contract reflects)
**Independent Validation**: `Amoebius.Spa.Contract` emits the PureScript contract types deterministically from
the composed ADTs; a Register-1 golden pins the emitted contract byte-for-byte; a repository check finds **no**
committed `*.purs` contract; the `spago` build of the lifted demo SPA type-checks against the freshly-generated
contract.
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/generated_artifacts_doctrine.md`,
`documents/engineering/lift_and_compose_doctrine.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system_components.md`

### Objective
Adopt [`generated_artifacts_doctrine.md`](../documents/engineering/generated_artifacts_doctrine.md) §2/§3 and
[`lift_and_compose_doctrine.md`](../documents/engineering/lift_and_compose_doctrine.md) §4: regenerate the
lifted infernix/jitML demo SPAs' frontend contract types from the amoebius-composed Haskell ADTs via
`purescript-bridge`, emitted fresh at build time and never committed, so the frontend contract cannot drift
from the composed types.

### Deliverables
- An `Amoebius.Spa.Contract` renderer that emits the PureScript contract types from the composed app/workflow
  ADTs, stamped generated ("do not edit by hand; edit the source and re-emit").
- The lifted infernix/jitML PureScript demo-SPA shells under `web/`, building with `spago` against the
  generated contract rather than a hand-maintained one.
- A Register-1 golden pinning the emitted `*.purs` byte-for-byte as a fixture of the renderer, with **no**
  generated contract committed to the repository.

### Validation
1. The generator emits the contract deterministically; the golden matches byte-for-byte; the repository holds
   no committed `*.purs` contract.
2. The `spago` build of the demo SPA type-checks against the freshly-generated contract.

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned).

## Sprint 12.4: The demo-SPA-local gate — Playwright against a faked backend + the ledger 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `test/spa/DemoSpaLocalSpec.hs` (the Register-2 driver + faked-backend fixture), `web/` (the
demo SPA served locally) (target paths; not yet built)
**Blocked by**: Sprint 12.2; Sprint 12.3; Phase 11 (the boundary fake-tool / faked-backend harness this reuses
for the local backend)
**Independent Validation**: the lifted PureScript demo SPA is served locally, wired to a **faked backend** (a
fake inference/API endpoint that records its calls), and driven end to end under **Playwright** — a chat turn
renders and the faked inference round-trip is asserted, with no cluster and no live infrastructure; the
composite gate ledger records `prop_spaCompositionDecodes` (Register 1) and the Playwright run (Register 2) as
green and the live SPA deploy ([Phase 32](phase_32_spa_live_deploy.md)) as UNVERIFIED.
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/conformance_harness_doctrine.md`,
`documents/engineering/testing_doctrine.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md`

### Objective
Adopt [`conformance_harness_doctrine.md`](../documents/engineering/conformance_harness_doctrine.md) §2/§3 (the
Register-2 demo-SPA-local move) and [`testing_doctrine.md §2`](../documents/engineering/testing_doctrine.md#2-three-registers-of-amoebius-testing):
serve the lifted demo SPA locally against a faked backend, drive it end to end under a browser driver, and
emit the composite proven/tested/assumed ledger for both halves of the gate — never a runtime claim.

### Deliverables
- A `test/spa/DemoSpaLocalSpec.hs` that serves the demo SPA locally, stands up a faked backend recording its
  argv/calls (reusing the Phase-11 fake-tool seam), and drives the SPA under Playwright — asserting a chat turn
  renders and the faked inference call round-trips.
- A composite gate ledger recording: the SPA composition + `prop_spaCompositionDecodes` as **proven for the
  spec composition** (Register 1), the local browser run as **tested (local, faked backend)** (Register 2), and
  the live SPA deploy, the Keycloak/Envoy edge, and any real inference as **explicitly UNVERIFIED** (owned by
  [Phase 32](phase_32_spa_live_deploy.md)).

### Validation
1. The demo SPA is driven end to end under Playwright against the faked backend; the asserted chat turn renders
   and the faked inference round-trip is recorded — no cluster, no live infra.
2. The composite ledger is emitted, marking Registers 1–2 green and the live deploy UNVERIFIED; it is
   structurally insufficient to advance any production `PromotionGate`.

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned).

## Documentation Requirements

**Engineering docs to update (when the gate runs, flip the honest layer, never before):**
- `documents/engineering/app_vs_deployment_doctrine.md` — backlink §8 to the worked representational SPA
  composition: a demo fragment composed as shared-library use, proven to decode with no substrate on its
  surface (status recorded here in the plan, never as doctrine status).
- `documents/engineering/service_capability_doctrine.md` — note the SPA `.dhall` as a worked multi-service
  surface composing capability needs (§2/§7) with no product literal.
- `documents/engineering/lift_and_compose_doctrine.md` — record the lifted infernix/jitML demo-SPA shells and
  their regenerated-from-Haskell contracts (§4) as the amoebius SPA-composition fixtures.
- `documents/engineering/generated_artifacts_doctrine.md` — record the emitted PureScript contract as a worked
  never-committed generated artifact with a Register-1 golden of the renderer.
- `documents/engineering/conformance_harness_doctrine.md` / `testing_doctrine.md` — record the Register-1
  composition battery and the Register-2 demo-SPA-local run, and the composite proven/tested/assumed ledger
  they emit (live deploy UNVERIFIED).

**Cross-references to add:**
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md` — flip the Phase-12 status when the gate passes; link this document.
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/substrates.md` — the Phase-12 `none` gate row.
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system_components.md` — register `src/Amoebius/Spa/{Spec,Workflow,Contract}.hs`, the
  `dhall/amoebius/Spa.dhall` type, the `dhall/examples/spa_*` fixtures, and the `web/` demo-SPA shells as
  Phase-12 design-first rows.
