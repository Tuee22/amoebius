## Phase Status

📋 Planned. Nothing in this phase is implemented; every sprint below is 📋 Planned and every prescriptive
statement is design intent, never a tested amoebius result. This phase opens after the Phase 23 gate (app
tenancy + `TenantSpec`) and runs on the **linux-cpu** substrate in **Register 3** — live infrastructure: a
single-node `kind` cluster with Pulsar up as a standard HA service (Phase 19). The mechanisms are generalized
from two working sibling libraries — infernix's in-process WebSocket Pulsar path and jitML's Node-subprocess
Pulsar path and topic algebra — and start from a fork of `cr-org/supernova`; that is **sibling evidence, not
an amoebius result** (honesty rule, [development_plan_standards.md §K](development_plan_standards.md)).

## Phase Summary

This phase delivers amoebius's **one and only transport to Pulsar**: a single native-protocol Haskell client,
`amoebius-pulsar`, speaking Pulsar's TCP binary protocol directly. There is no WebSocket transport, no
HTTP-upgrade side-door, and no second-language runtime; this client replaces both sibling transports outright.
It owns four things. First, the **native binary protocol** — length-prefixed `proto-lens`-generated
`BaseCommand` frames, the `0x0e02`/`0x0e01` magic + mandatory CRC32C payload tail, and one persistent TCP
session per broker with lookup-based service discovery. Second, the **five-verb capability surface** —
lookup · produce · consume · subscribe · seek — with all four subscription types exposed (Exclusive, Failover,
Shared, Key_Shared) and role-selection deliberately left to the daemon-topology layer, so the client only
exposes and never picks. Third, the **exclusively-CBOR payload codec**: every application payload is CBOR
through a typed codec (`serialise`/`cborg`); a non-CBOR application body (JSON/base64/protobuf/raw) is
unrepresentable, while the protocol framing itself stays protobuf. Fourth, the **declarative topology
algebra** — topic names are *derived* from a typed `RouteEntry` descriptor, never hand-written, and a graph
that fails one-sided-link / duplicate / empty-lane validation cannot be reconciled — and the **at-least-once +
broker-side dedup** delivery contract, with `(producer_name, sequence_id)` as a first-class protocol field.

What this phase deliberately does **not** do: the three-tier content-addressed MinIO store and the
orchestrator/worker workflow runtime with Pulsar-Failover single-writer takeover (both Phase 25), the topic
storage-lifecycle reconcile (retention / size-triggered S3 offload / backlog quota, consumed later), and any
intra-cluster HA proof — Pulsar's own broker/bookie consensus is **delegated, not re-proven**. This phase
exposes the four subscription types but runs **no bespoke election**: any single-writer property is delegated
to the broker's subscription model.

**Substrate:** linux-cpu — the whole gate runs on a single-node `kind` cluster on a linux-cpu host; no apple,
linux-cuda, or windows substrate is touched (the per-substrate topic lanes the algebra partitions traffic onto
are exercised by later phases).

**Register:** 3 (live infrastructure) — the gate runs against a real broker on a real cluster, not an
in-process fake.

**Gate:** on a `linux-cpu` kind cluster with Pulsar up as a standard HA service (Phase 19), an `InForceSpec`
test topology **round-trips a workflow command → event over the native Pulsar binary protocol with
broker-side deduplication enabled**, a **CBOR command/event payload round-trips byte-for-byte** through the
typed codec, and a **fixture attempting a non-CBOR payload fails to type-check** — the topology spinning up,
running, and tearing down leak-free and idempotently on re-run, emitting a Register-3 proven/tested/assumed
ledger. The topic descriptor also round-trips its required `StorageBudgetId` and complete
`PulsarOffloadObjectDemand` source operands (segment size, offload concurrency/rate window, deletion lag,
failure/orphan horizon, and admission model); Phase 19 owns the live MinIO geometry/drill.

The gate passes only when every clause below holds; each is checked against a **Phase-0-committed oracle**
authored before `amoebius-pulsar` exists (§M.1), not a value regenerated from the client.

- **Committed oracle corpus (representative set, §M.7, §M.1).** The gate's representative set is named
  explicitly and committed under `amoebius-pulsar/test/golden/` in Phase 0: (a) spec-derived byte goldens for
  the `BaseCommand` frame set `{CONNECT, CONNECTED, LOOKUP_TOPIC, PRODUCER, PRODUCER_SUCCESS, SEND,
  SEND_RECEIPT, SUBSCRIBE, FLOW, MESSAGE, ACK, ACK_RESPONSE, SEEK}` derived by hand from the Pulsar protocol
  spec (never from `proto-lens` output of this fork); (b) a CBOR command vector and event vector with their
  hand-computed canonical-CBOR byte strings; (c) the non-CBOR negative fixtures of Sprint 24.2 V4 with their
  expected compile diagnostics; (d) the gate topology's `RouteEntry` descriptor `round_trip_dedup.dhall` and a
  hand-written expected derived-topic table (the `persistent://<tenant>/<ns>/<workflow>.<phase>.linux-cpu`
  strings), authored independently of `topicFor` (§M.3); (e) a pre-run snapshot of the standing Phase-18
  namespace's policy set.
- **Topology algebra is on the gate path (§M.3).** The gate topology's produced and consumed topic names are
  asserted equal to the committed expected derived-topic table of (d) — the gate uses `topicFor`-derived topics,
  not hand-written strings — and a companion negative gate run seeds the same topology with a one-sided link and
  asserts `validateTopology` refuses it **before any broker socket is opened**.
- **Non-CBOR foreclosure is checked by reason (§M.8).** The gate's non-CBOR clause passes only when the
  compile-fail harness matches each fixture's committed expected diagnostic and the API-surface golden of
  §M below holds; an ill-typed file failing for an unrelated reason does not satisfy it.
- **Committed seeded mutants must go red (§M.2).** The gate re-runs a committed mutant set and asserts each
  turns it red: (i) a `topicFor` mutant that emits a literal topic string instead of the derived name;
  (ii) a `validateTopology` mutant with the one-sided-link clause deleted (invariant-clause delete);
  (iii) a codec mutant exposing a raw-`ByteString` `produceRaw` (union-arm addition). A green gate under any
  mutant is a failed gate.
- **Leak-free is an external enumerate-and-compare sweep (§M.5).** "Leak-free" is defined as: after teardown,
  the harness enumerates all topics, subscriptions/cursors, and namespaces in the test tenant **by querying the
  standing broker's admin surface** (an observer external to the client under test, not the client's own
  bookkeeping) and asserts the set is empty, and asserts the standing Phase-18 namespace's policy set
  (including the deduplication policy) equals the pre-run snapshot of (e).
- **Idempotency forces an independent recompute (§M.6).** "Idempotent on re-run" means the topology is
  re-applied a second time against a **distinct test namespace** (cache-bypass: no reuse of the first run's
  namespace, cursors, or dedup cursor) and the setup/round-trip path is asserted to have actually executed on
  run 2 — a no-op served by leftover state from run 1 fails the gate.

### Resource-provisioning contract

This phase instantiates the canonical resource matrix and sealed whole-deployment provision boundary from
[`resource_capacity_doctrine.md §3.1`](../documents/engineering/resource_capacity_doctrine.md#31-the-systematic-provision-matrix)
and [`§4`](../documents/engineering/resource_capacity_doctrine.md#4-the-total-fold-fits-carve-place-and-the-nesting);
embedded client demand must be charged to a canonical execution envelope.

`amoebius-pulsar` is a library, not a hidden standalone daemon: it creates no resource-free client Pod. A pure
`PulsarClientExecutionDemand` names maximum broker connections, producers, consumers, outstanding requests,
in-flight frames, frame/payload bytes, FLOW permits, redelivery/replay window, CBOR encode/decode workspace,
and reconnect burst. Binding compiles those operands into the complete `PodResourceEnvelope` of each consuming
orchestrator/worker. The Phase-24 live gate therefore declares a client-runner Pod with immutable image and OCI
import footprint; CPU, memory, and ephemeral-storage requests and limits; runtime working set; writable-root
and log headroom; projected credentials/config/service-account-token bytes; local volumes; pod slot;
exact byte-free `PodRuntimeMetadataSource` network-attachment identities and container-to-volume mount
identities; `cache = None`; and `accelerator = None`. Later phases must re-bind the same client demand into
their own Pod envelopes rather than borrowing the gate runner's capacity. The finite gate runner is
structurally a Job body with `completions=1`, `parallelism=1`, `restartPolicy=Never`, replacement-on-Failed,
bounded backoff, and finite terminal retention; it does not carry Deployment rollout fields. After the runner's
`BoundExecutionUnit` is expanded, `provision` derives one `KubeletRuntimeMetadataShape` per planned Pod slot
from that source and the complete container/volume graph under the selected node's pinned
`kubeletMetadataModel`; live readback constructs the observed form under the authenticated Pod UID and source
witness. The private fold derives each component's bytes and `KubeletNodefs | CriRuntimeRoot` role, resolves
the role through the selected filesystem layout, and groups aliases by physical carve once. SplitRuntime
charges kubelet components to nodefs and CRI components to imagefs/containerfs; Unified and SplitImage sum
forced aliases before one backing check. These physical bytes are not repeated as logical Pod ephemeral demand.

Pure provision represents each planned epoch, and live preflight each observed snapshot, by one
`ProvisionedNodeRuntimeStorageAccounting` per node. Its planned-slot/observed-UID domain equals the assigned
Pods exactly, its qualified Pod metadata keys and image-model component keys form a disjoint exhaustive
partition, and its combined backing map debits each carve once. A missing/swapped role, wrong backing, scope or
domain mismatch, ownership hole/overlap, or alias double debit rejects before any broker socket opens.

Topics and subscriptions are not free either. Each descriptor retains its hot-ledger/backlog operands and its
required `StorageBudgetId` plus complete `PulsarOffloadObjectDemand` (exact topic identity, retained and segment
bytes, concurrent/rate-window offloads, deletion lag, failed/orphan horizon, mutation admission). The Phase-19
Pulsar provisioner merges these with BookKeeper/ZooKeeper, broker execution, and the closed six-arm MinIO
producer inventory. The whole-deployment check runs against a live snapshot before opening a broker socket or
changing a namespace policy. Only the private provisioned client/topic projection reaches the gate runner and
reconciler. Pure expansion gives every desired/prior object a `KubernetesApiObjectDemand`; live preflight
joins the observed old/new/apply transition map. `EtcdLogicalDemand { desiredObjects, churn, model }` derives
the private logical peak, which must fit `ControlPlaneStorageDemand.etcd.backendQuotaBytes`, before the
backend-at-quota plus WAL/snapshot/serialized-defrag peak separately fits its physical backing. Normalized live
Pod resources, API/etcd state, and broker topic/subscription/offload policy must equal the witness.

Exact-fit/one-short cases cover every client buffer/concurrency term, Pod CPU/memory/ephemeral/image/log term,
runtime-metadata shape/component/role and each grouped layout backing, hot ledger/backlog, object count/segment size, offload
concurrency/failure, budget, API-object revision/Event, and etcd term. Mutants that omit the
client runner, a reconnect/redelivery buffer, a subscription cursor, the offload producer, one desired API
object, a churn operand, metadata role/domain/ownership/grouping, the kubelet metadata model or largest simultaneous metadata row, or the etcd model must reject before
the first CONNECT or broker-admin mutation; a successful command/event round-trip cannot excuse an omitted
provision.

## Doctrine adopted

- [`pulsar_client_doctrine.md §1`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#1-one-client-one-wire-no-websockets)
  — *one client, one wire, no WebSockets*: this phase builds the single native-protocol client the doctrine
  mandates and deletes both sibling WebSocket/Node transports; lookup, produce, consume, subscribe, and seek
  ride the native protocol or they do not happen.
- [`pulsar_client_doctrine.md §3`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#3-the-native-binary-protocol)
  and [`§4`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#4-forked-from-supernova--what-amoebius-inherits-and-what-it-builds)
  — *the native binary protocol* and *forked from supernova*: `proto-lens`-generated `BaseCommand` framing
  with hand-written size prefixes / magic / CRC32C only, one persistent TCP session per broker, forked from
  `cr-org/supernova` onto the repo-wide GHC 9.12.4 pin — treated as a *starting point with sibling provenance*,
  not a proven foundation.
- [`pulsar_client_doctrine.md §5`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#5-the-capability-surface-lookup--produce--consume--subscribe--seek)
  — *the capability surface: lookup · produce · consume · subscribe · seek*: long-lived producers,
  flow-controlled consumers, all four subscription types exposed (the client exposes, the daemon-topology
  layer picks), and seek-based replay.
- [`pulsar_client_doctrine.md §3.1`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#31-payloads-are-exclusively-cbor)
  — *payloads are exclusively CBOR*: every application payload is CBOR through a typed codec, canonical where
  content-addressed; a non-CBOR body has no inhabitant
  ([`illegal_state_catalog.md §3.23`](../documents/illegal_state/illegal_state_capability_messaging.md#323-a-non-cbor-pulsar-payload)).
- [`pulsar_client_doctrine.md §6`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#6-the-declarative-topology-algebra)
  — *the declarative topology algebra*: topic names are a derived function of a typed `RouteEntry`, and an
  unroutable graph is a validation error returning the full violation list, not a runtime mystery.
- [`pulsar_client_doctrine.md §7`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#7-delivery-at-least-once-with-broker-side-dedup-the-robust-default)
  — *delivery: at-least-once with broker-side dedup*: at-least-once made effectively-once by **broker-side**
  namespace deduplication on `(producer_name, sequence_id)`; intra-cluster consensus is delegated, not
  re-proven.
- [`substrate_doctrine.md`](../documents/engineering/substrate_doctrine.md) §2 — *lazy, absolute-path tool
  discovery*: the supernova fork's `protoc`/`proto-lens` codegen is discovered lazily by full path through the
  substrate package manager — no `PATH` lookup and no environment variable anywhere in the build or runtime
  path.

## Sprints

## Sprint 24.1: Fork supernova → amoebius-pulsar native binary protocol 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `amoebius-pulsar/src/Amoebius/Pulsar/Frame.hs`,
`amoebius-pulsar/src/Amoebius/Pulsar/Connection.hs`, and `amoebius-pulsar/proto/PulsarApi.proto` — the authored
source; `Amoebius/Pulsar/Proto/PulsarApi.hs` is `proto-lens`-generated at build from that `.proto`, never
hand-written (target layout from [system_components.md](system_components.md); not yet built).
**Blocked by**: Phase 19 — Pulsar reachable as a standard HA service (external earlier-phase prerequisite);
Phase 15 — the baked Pulsar/service binaries in the in-cluster `distribution` registry.
**Independent Validation**: golden-frame encode/decode round-trips of representative `BaseCommand` types
byte-for-byte against spec-derived fixtures; a CONNECT → CONNECTED → LOOKUP_TOPIC exchange against a
single-node broker resolves a topic owner through any redirects; a deliberately corrupted CRC32C payload frame
yields a structured decode error, never a silent drop.
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md` (§3, §4),
`documents/engineering/substrate_doctrine.md` (the no-env/no-`PATH` lazy `protoc` discovery the fork conforms
to).

### Objective
Adopt [`pulsar_client_doctrine.md §3`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#3-the-native-binary-protocol)
and [`§4`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#4-forked-from-supernova--what-amoebius-inherits-and-what-it-builds):
fork `cr-org/supernova` into the `amoebius-pulsar` package on the repo-wide GHC 9.12.4 pin, and stand up the
framing layer, the CONNECT/CONNECTED handshake, and LOOKUP-based service discovery over one persistent TCP
session per broker — the supernova provenance as **sibling evidence, not an amoebius result**.

### Deliverables
- The `amoebius-pulsar` cabal package forked from supernova, dependency bounds bumped to GHC 9.12.4.
- A frame codec: simple commands (`totalSize` · `commandSize` · `command`) and payload commands (command +
  optional broker-entry-metadata block behind `0x0e02` + magic `0x0e01` + mandatory CRC32C + `metadata` + raw
  `payload`), rejecting any frame over the 5 MiB maximum; only the framing is hand-written, never the protobuf
  bodies.
- `proto-lens`-generated `PulsarApi` (`BaseCommand` + message metadata) from `PulsarApi.proto`; hand-rolled
  protobuf body parsing is forbidden.
- A `Connection` that performs CONNECT → CONNECTED and resolves topics by looping on `LOOKUP_TOPIC`
  Connect/Redirect responses, multiplexing producers and consumers by `producer_id` / `consumer_id` /
  `request_id`.
- A structural `PulsarClientExecutionDemand` for connection/request/frame/reconnect peaks, bound into the
  complete envelope of the Phase-24 client-runner Pod and, later, each actual consumer Pod; there is no
  separately scheduled or uncharged client service.
- Any codegen tool (`protoc`) discovered lazily by full path through the substrate package manager — no
  environment variable, no `PATH` lookup, anywhere in the build or runtime path.

### Validation
1. Encode/decode golden frames for representative `BaseCommand` types and assert byte-for-byte equality
   against spec-derived fixtures.
2. Drive CONNECT → CONNECTED → LOOKUP_TOPIC against a single-node broker on the `linux-cpu` kind cluster and
   assert the client reaches an owning broker through any redirects.
3. Flip one byte of a payload frame's body and assert a structured CRC32C-mismatch decode error, never a
   silent drop.
4. Make the client-runner CPU, memory, ephemeral, image/import, log, connection, outstanding-frame, or
   reconnect term one unit short in turn; each fixture refuses before CONNECT. The exact-fit runner's live
   requests/limits/image/local storage normalize to the private provisioned projection.

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned).

## Sprint 24.2: Capability surface + exclusively-CBOR payload codec 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `amoebius-pulsar/src/Amoebius/Pulsar/Producer.hs`,
`amoebius-pulsar/src/Amoebius/Pulsar/Consumer.hs`, `amoebius-pulsar/src/Amoebius/Pulsar/Subscription.hs`,
`amoebius-pulsar/src/Amoebius/Pulsar/Seek.hs`, `amoebius-pulsar/src/Amoebius/Pulsar/Cbor.hs` (the typed CBOR
payload codec on `serialise`/`cborg`) — target paths, not yet built.
**Blocked by**: Sprint 24.1.
**Independent Validation**: run against the **live single-node `kind`-cluster broker (Register 3)** — the same
standing Pulsar service as the gate, not an in-process fake — so the FLOW/MESSAGE/ACK_RESPONSE and
four-subscription-shape assertions are wire-real: a persistent producer sends N messages and collects N
`SEND_RECEIPT`s with assigned `message_id`s; a consumer grants `FLOW` permits, receives `MESSAGE` frames up to
the permits, and `ACK`s (confirmed by `ACK_RESPONSE`); each of the four subscription types exhibits its
distinct delivery shape; a `SEEK` to an earlier `message_id` replays the log; a typed value round-trips through
the CBOR codec byte-for-byte against the Phase-0-committed CBOR vector, a fixture attempting a non-CBOR payload
has no constructor (fails to type-check with its committed expected diagnostic), and a corrupt CBOR body yields
a structured `Left DecodeError` on consume.
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md` (§5, §3.1),
`documents/illegal_state/illegal_state_catalog.md` (§3.23).

### Objective
Adopt [`pulsar_client_doctrine.md §5`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#5-the-capability-surface-lookup--produce--consume--subscribe--seek)
and [`§3.1`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#31-payloads-are-exclusively-cbor): build the
five-verb client surface — long-lived producers, flow-controlled consumers, all four subscription types, and
seek-based replay — over the persistent session from Sprint 24.1, with **every application payload encoded
exclusively as CBOR** through a typed codec.

### Deliverables
- A producer: `PRODUCER` → `PRODUCER_SUCCESS` binds a `producer_id` + `producer_name`; each `SEND` carries
  `producer_id` and a first-class `sequence_id`; replies are `SEND_RECEIPT` (with `message_id`) or
  `SEND_ERROR`. One long-lived producer session — no per-publish connection churn, no base64-in-JSON inflation.
- A consumer: `SUBSCRIBE` binds a `consumer_id` + subscription; consumer-granted `FLOW` permits are the
  backpressure knob; the broker pushes `MESSAGE` frames; the consumer `ACK`s and receives `ACK_RESPONSE`.
- All four subscription types exposed — **Exclusive**, **Failover** (primary + name-ordered standbys),
  **Shared** (round-robin), **Key_Shared** (same key → same consumer); the client exposes all four and does
  **not** pick and runs **no** election — role-selection is owned by the daemon-topology layer.
- `SEEK` repositioning a subscription to an earlier `message_id` or timestamp for replay.
- A typed **CBOR payload codec** (`Amoebius.Pulsar.Cbor`, on `serialise`/`cborg`): `produce`/`consume` accept
  only a `Serialise`-constrained value (equivalently a `CborPayload` whose sole constructor is
  `encodeCbor :: Serialise a => a -> CborPayload`); there is **no** `produceRaw`, no JSON/protobuf/base64 path,
  so a non-CBOR body is unrepresentable (type-foreclosed). Consume is a total `Either DecodeError a`. Canonical
  CBOR (shared with the store's canonical encoder, Phase 25) is used where the payload is content-addressed; a
  large-artifact payload carries a manifest-SHA reference, never the raw blob inline; the broker sees opaque
  `BYTES`.

### Validation
1. Produce N messages over one persistent producer and assert N `SEND_RECEIPT`s with monotonic `message_id`s.
2. For each subscription type, attach the matching consumer set and assert its delivery shape (single reader;
   primary-then-standby ordering; round-robin spread; per-key affinity).
3. Consume a prefix, `SEEK` back, and assert the earlier messages are redelivered.
4. A typed command/event round-trips through the CBOR codec byte-for-byte against the Phase-0-committed CBOR
   vector. Non-CBOR foreclosure is proven **by specific reason** (§M.8), not by any compile failure: the
   compile-fail harness carries one negative fixture **per foreclosed route** — raw `ByteString`, JSON,
   base64 — each committed in Phase 0 with its expected diagnostic (respectively `No instance for (Serialise
   ByteString)` / `produceRaw not in scope` / `No instance for (Serialise …)` as authored), each paired with a
   positive fixture that differs only in wrapping the body through `encodeCbor` and does type-check; the harness
   asserts the diagnostic *matches the committed tag*, so a fixture that fails for an unrelated reason (typo,
   missing import) does not satisfy the clause. An **API-surface golden** — a committed hand-authored expected
   listing (independent of the codec source, §M.3) of `amoebius-pulsar`'s exported `produce`/`consume`
   signatures — is diffed against the package's actual export list and asserts **no exported function accepts an
   unconstrained `ByteString` payload** and no `produceRaw`/frame-level raw-send is exported. A committed seeded
   mutant that re-adds a `produceRaw :: ByteString -> …` export (union-arm addition operator) must turn this
   validation red. A corrupted CBOR body yields a structured `Left DecodeError` on consume (decode-foreclosed,
   like CRC32C), never a silent misread.

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned).

## Sprint 24.3: Declarative topology algebra + one-sided-link validation 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `amoebius-pulsar/src/Amoebius/Pulsar/Topology.hs` — target path, not yet built.
**Blocked by**: none (pure derivation; no broker or session required).
**Independent Validation**: property tests that `topicFor` derives
`persistent://<tenant>/<namespace>/<workflow>.<phase>.<substrate>` from a typed `RouteEntry`, checked against a
**Phase-0-committed hand-authored expected-topic table** (a distinct spec of the naming scheme, not
`topicFor`'s own output re-fed as its own oracle, §M.3); `validateTopology` returns the **full** violation list
on graphs seeded with duplicates, empty lanes, and one-sided links; an `emit-only` workflow (the `gc` exemplar)
is accepted despite having reports with no producing input.
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md` (§6).

### Objective
Adopt [`pulsar_client_doctrine.md §6`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#6-the-declarative-topology-algebra):
make topic names a derived function of a typed descriptor and make an unroutable graph a validation error, not
a runtime mystery — the illegal-state-unrepresentable principle applied to the message bus.

### Deliverables
- A typed `RouteEntry { workflow, phase, lanes, liveness }` descriptor as the single source of truth, and a
  `topicFor` derivation producing the fully-qualified `<workflow>.<phase>.<substrate>` topic — no hand-written
  topic strings anywhere.
- Both the per-substrate reconciled topic set and a substrate-stripped *logical* topic family derived from the
  same descriptor, so per-substrate routing cannot diverge from the declared logical set.
- `validateTopology` rejecting (1) duplicate derived topics, (2) entries with no lanes, and (3) one-sided
  links on a `(workflow, lane)` pair — an input with no report, or a report with no producing input — with an
  explicit `emit-only` exemption; it returns the **full** list of violations so an author fixes the whole graph
  in one pass.

### Validation
1. Property test: for each generated `RouteEntry`, `topicFor descriptor` equals the entry computed by the
   **Phase-0-committed independent expected-topic table** (§M.3) — not merely equal to `topicFor` mapped over
   the descriptor, which is a tautology. "No code path accepts a literal topic string" is made concrete as a
   **type-level foreclosure that reaches the wire layer**: `Connection`'s `LOOKUP_TOPIC` and the produce/consume
   entry points accept only a `Topic` newtype whose sole constructor is private and produced only by `topicFor`;
   an **API-surface golden** (committed, hand-authored) asserts no exported function on the reconcile-or-wire
   path takes a bare `Text`/`String` topic, and a committed compile-fail fixture attempting to build a `Topic`
   from a string literal fails with its expected diagnostic.
2. Feed validation graphs with seeded duplicate / empty-lane / one-sided-link defects and assert the complete
   violation list (not just the first) is returned. The property generator carries `cover`/`classify`
   obligations (§M.4) forcing each defect class — duplicate, empty-lane, one-sided-link, and the multi-defect
   graph — to fire in **≥20%** of generated cases each, so the reject path is exercised, not a near-constant
   legal graph. A committed seeded mutant with the one-sided-link clause deleted from `validateTopology`
   (invariant-clause-delete operator) must turn this validation red.
3. Assert an `emit-only` workflow with unsourced reports validates, while the same graph without the exemption
   is rejected — a positive/negative pair differing only in the exemption flag (§M.8).
4. Prove the algebra is on the gate path, not dead code (§M.3): the gate topology `round_trip_dedup.dhall`
   carries a committed `RouteEntry` descriptor, and the Sprint-22.4 gate run asserts the actually-produced and
   actually-consumed topic names equal the committed derived-topic table — the reconcile/gate path derives its
   topics through `topicFor`, never from hand-written strings.

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned).

## Sprint 24.4: At-least-once + broker-side dedup + the command→event round-trip gate 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `amoebius-pulsar/src/Amoebius/Pulsar/Dedup.hs`,
`amoebius-pulsar/src/Amoebius/Pulsar/Namespace.hs` (the namespace dedup-policy reconcile),
`amoebius-pulsar/dhall/test/round_trip_dedup.dhall` (the gate topology), and
`test/integration/Phase24RuntimeStorage.hs` (runner planned-slot→observed-Pod-UID join, component-role/layout
backings, node scope/domain/ownership equality, reservation/observed no-double-debit, alias controls) — target paths, not yet built.
**Blocked by**: Sprint 24.2, Sprint 24.3; Phase 22 — the live DSL deploy via the `replicas=1` singleton (the
`InForceSpec` harness that applies the gate topology).
**Independent Validation**: with namespace deduplication enabled, a producer that retries the same
`(producer_name, sequence_id)` has the duplicate rejected at ingest; a consumer that crashes before `ACK` is
redelivered the un-acked message; the `MessageId`→`sequence_id` packing (`ledgerId`/`entryId`) and the
request-scoped-producer-name fallback both keep distinct keys off one dedup cursor; the gate topology
round-trips a command → event, byte-for-byte CBOR, and tears down leak-free and idempotently.
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md` (§7),
`DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md` (flip the Phase-24 status when the gate passes).

### Objective
Adopt [`pulsar_client_doctrine.md §7`](../documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md#7-delivery-at-least-once-with-broker-side-dedup-the-robust-default):
default to at-least-once delivery made effectively-once by **broker-side** deduplication, so a retried
producer or a redelivered consumer cannot corrupt idempotent state — then assemble the phase gate: a
command→event round-trip over the native protocol with dedup on and CBOR payloads.

### Deliverables
- The **broker half**: a reconcile step that enables Pulsar's namespace deduplication policy so the broker
  tracks `(producer_name, sequence_id)` and rejects duplicates at ingest.
- The **producer half**: every publish carries a stable `producer_name` and a monotonic `sequence_id` within
  that producer scope, with producer-name scoping chosen so unrelated keys never share one dedup cursor.
- The `sequence_id` derivation: when a message has a causal upstream `MessageId`
  (`<ledgerId>:<entryId>:<partition>:<batchIdx>`), pack `ledgerId`/`entryId` into a 64-bit `sequence_id`;
  otherwise fall back to a stable hash of a generated request id paired with a request-scoped producer name.
- At-least-once consumer discipline: `ACK` only after processing; un-acked messages are redelivered after a
  crash or rebalance.
- The gate `round_trip_dedup.dhall` `InForceSpec` topology, carrying a committed `RouteEntry` descriptor so its
  topics are `topicFor`-derived, not hand-written: bring up against the standing Pulsar service, produce a
  workflow `command`, consume it, produce the corresponding `event`, consume it back — all CBOR — and always
  tear down, emitting a per-run proven/tested/assumed ledger.
- A pure provision boundary covering the client runner, exact topic/subscription/cursor set, hot
  BookKeeper/ZooKeeper demand, and complete `PulsarOffloadObjectDemand`/`StorageBudgetId`, followed by
  snapshot-bound preflight of observed/reserved/terminating identities and node runtime/image-storage rows; no
  broker socket or namespace mutation occurs on `Left ProvisionError` or live-preflight refusal.
- The Phase-0-committed gate oracles (§M.1), authored before the client exists: the CBOR command/event byte
  vectors, the hand-authored expected derived-topic table, the standing-namespace pre-run policy snapshot, and
  the committed seeded-mutant set (topicFor-literal, one-sided-link-clause-deleted, produceRaw-re-added) each
  asserted to turn the gate red (§M.2).

### Validation
1. Run the gate topology end-to-end on the `linux-cpu` kind cluster and assert: a workflow command round-trips
   to an event over the native protocol with broker-side dedup enabled; the CBOR payloads round-trip
   byte-for-byte against the Phase-0-committed CBOR command/event vectors; the produced and consumed topic
   names equal the committed derived-topic table (§M.3, algebra on the gate path); a fixture attempting a
   non-CBOR payload fails to type-check with its committed expected diagnostic (§M.8). A companion negative gate
   run seeds the same topology with a one-sided link and asserts `validateTopology` refuses it **before any
   broker socket is opened**.
2. Enable namespace dedup, publish the same `(producer_name, sequence_id)` twice, and assert the broker
   collapses the duplicate; kill a consumer between receive and `ACK` and assert redelivery on reconnect.
3. **Idempotency (§M.6) — re-apply, not re-run-from-clean.** Re-apply the topology a second time against a
   **distinct test namespace** (cache-bypass: no reuse of run 1's namespace, cursors, producer name, or dedup
   cursor) and assert the setup/round-trip path **actually executed** on run 2 (a no-op served by leftover run-1
   state fails); re-enabling the namespace dedup policy on an already-enabled namespace is a no-op success
   (idempotent). **Leak-free teardown** is proven by an **external enumerate-and-compare sweep** (§M.5): after
   teardown, an observer external to the client queries the standing broker's admin surface and asserts the test
   tenant contains **zero** topics, subscriptions/cursors, and namespaces, and asserts the standing Phase-18
   namespace's policy set (including the deduplication policy) equals the Phase-0-committed pre-run snapshot —
   subscriptions, stray topics, and a left-enabled dedup policy each fail the assertion. Emit the Register-3
   ledger — the deferred content-store, workflow-runtime, and cross-cluster surfaces (Phase 25 and later)
   recorded UNVERIFIED, never green.
4. Run one-short and omission mutants for the client-runner envelope, session buffers, cursor/backlog, offload
   demand, both SplitRuntime metadata backings, role resolution, planned/observed domain, qualified ownership,
   and alias grouping. Assert zero CONNECT frames and zero broker-admin writes for every rejection; for the
   exact-fit twin, externally read Pod and broker policy/state normalize exactly to the provisioned value.

## Sprint 24.5: Register-2.5 exactly-once effect under simulated redelivery 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `test/sim/PulsarDedupSimSpec.hs` (the `IOSimPOR` battery over the modeled Pulsar), driving
the real `amoebius-pulsar/src/Amoebius/Pulsar/Dedup.hs` consumer-side fold lifted onto the Phase-12
`io-classes` `Env` interface — target paths, not yet built.
**Blocked by**: Sprint 24.4 (the built at-least-once + dedup client); the Phase 12 gate (the `io-classes`
seams + the modeled Pulsar).
**Independent Validation**: the real dedup fold — keyed by a replication-surviving work-id — runs under
`IOSimPOR` against the modeled Pulsar with injected reorder, duplicate, crash-mid-acknowledge, and partition;
the suite asserts the **exactly-once effect** invariant (R3): on every explored schedule, no effect is lost and
none is double-applied. This is the amoebius-owned fold; Pulsar's broker/bookie consensus stays delegated and
is *modeled*, not re-proven. Deterministically replayable, substrate `none`, Register 2.5.
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/deterministic_simulation_doctrine.md` (Phase-24 status backlink),
`documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system_components.md`.

### Objective
Adopt [`deterministic_simulation_doctrine.md §3/§4`](../documents/engineering/deterministic_simulation_doctrine.md#3-the-simulated-environment-and-its-fault-model)
and the R3 rule ([`chaos_failover_doctrine.md §13`](../documents/engineering/chaos_failover_doctrine.md#13-the-supporting-rules--the-conditions-the-moves-need)):
validate that the *built* dedup fold makes at-least-once delivery effectively-once under adversarial
redelivery/reorder/crash schedules **in-process and deterministically replayable**, before the Register-3 live
gate — the interleaving a single-threaded test cannot reach.

### Deliverables
- The `PulsarDedupSimSpec` battery: the real dedup fold under `IOSimPOR` against the modeled Pulsar, asserting
  no-loss + no-double-apply under injected reorder/duplicate/crash-mid-ack/partition schedules.
- A Register-2.5 proven/tested/assumed ledger — the fold upholds exactly-once under the modeled schedules and
  faults; honest limit: modeled-Pulsar fidelity is **assumed**, discharged by the Sprint-22.4 Register-3 live
  gate.

### Validation
1. `cabal test pulsar-dedup-sim` is green — no schedule loses or double-applies an effect; a deliberately broken
   fold (a non-stable key, an ack-before-process) is caught red; the discovered counterexample replays
   identically under its seed.

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned).

## Documentation Requirements

**Engineering docs to update (when the gate runs, flip the honest layer, never before):**
- `documents/engineering/pulsar_client_doctrine.md` — record that §1, §3–§7 (no-WebSockets rule, native
  protocol, supernova fork, capability surface, topology algebra, dedup contract) **and §3.1 (the
  exclusively-CBOR payload codec)** are realized in `amoebius-pulsar`; flip the relevant sibling-evidence
  honesty notes to delivered once the gate runs (status itself stays in this plan).
- `documents/illegal_state/illegal_state_catalog.md` — annotate §3.23 (non-CBOR payload) with its realized
  layer: produce-side type-foreclosed uninhabitable, consume-side decode-foreclosed total decode, no
  runtime-checked claim.
- `documents/engineering/substrate_doctrine.md` — record that the supernova fork's `protoc`/`proto-lens`
  codegen conforms to the no-env/no-`PATH` lazy-tool-ensure contract.
- `documents/engineering/daemon_topology_doctrine.md` — record that the client exposes all four subscription
  types (including Failover) but runs no election; role-selection and single-writer takeover are that doc's,
  landing in Phase 25.

**Cross-references to add:**
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system_components.md` — register the `amoebius-pulsar` package and its target module paths
  (`Frame`, `Connection`, `Proto/PulsarApi`, `Producer`, `Consumer`, `Subscription`, `Seek`, `Cbor`,
  `Topology`, `Dedup`, `Namespace`) as Phase-24 design-first rows against the component inventory.
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/substrates.md` — record Phase 24's gate substrate (`linux-cpu`) in the per-phase substrate
  map, and the topology algebra's per-substrate topic lanes.
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md` — flip the Phase-24 row's status from this plan once the gate passes; link this
  document.
