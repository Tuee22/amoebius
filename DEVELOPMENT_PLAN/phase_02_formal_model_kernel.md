> **Purpose**: Build the reusable formal-model kernel — the reifiable Haskell `Model` fragment and its two total renderings, the in-process `interpret` explorer and the `emitTLA` TLA+ emitter — and prove them on one small model whose generated `.tla` is TLC-checkable and never committed.

---

## Phase Status

📋 Planned. Specified before implementation; every sprint below is 📋 Planned and every prescriptive
statement here is design intent, never a tested amoebius result. This phase opens after the Phase 1
toolchain spike records a green (or remediated) build of the pinned Haskell surface, and runs on **no
substrate** (`none`) — it stands up no host and no cluster and touches no live infrastructure. The
round-trip mechanism it builds was demonstrated once in a throwaway spike over a small transition system
([`formal_model_doctrine.md §7`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#7-prototype-validation) —
the prototype-validation note); that is **spike evidence that the mechanism works, not a built amoebius
result**, and the implementation is what this phase delivers.

## Phase Summary

This phase delivers the **formal-model kernel** amoebius's one proof obligation will later be expressed in:
a single reifiable Haskell `Model` value from which both the runtime decision core and the TLA+ specification
are total functions, so the model↔code correspondence holds by construction. It stands up three things and
nothing more. First, the `Model` fragment itself — a deliberately small, first-order, side-effect-free
transition-system EDSL (named state variables, an initial assignment, guarded parameterized actions, named
boolean *safety* invariants, per-action *fairness* annotations, named *liveness* (temporal) properties, and
an optional bounding constraint). Second, the two total renderings of that value:
`interpret :: Model -> (Event -> State -> State)`, the pure decision core, paired with an in-process
bounded-reachability explorer that walks reachable states the same way TLC does; and
`emitTLA :: Model -> (Tla, Cfg)`, a structural walk of the fragment that emits a TLA+ module and its `.cfg`.
Third, the never-committed discipline: the `.tla`/`.cfg` are build artifacts emitted fresh by an `amoebius`
subcommand, stamped generated, and produced only at check time.

The one concrete protocol amoebius proves itself — the cross-cluster gateway migration, both branches — is
**not** authored here; that is [Phase 3](phase_03_gateway_migration_model.md). This phase proves the *kernel*
on a small, throwaway transition-system model (a bounded two-process mutual-exclusion or token model) so the
machinery is trustworthy before a load-bearing model rides on it. Validation is entirely in-process
([`conformance_harness_doctrine.md`](../documents/engineering/conformance_harness_doctrine.md) §2 — the
registers, and §3 — rendering never touches live infrastructure): the explorer is a `cabal test`, and TLC
runs on the emitted spec through the version-stable JVM `tla2tools` toolchain. This is a **Register 1**
(pure/golden, in-process, no cluster) design-proof phase.

**Substrate:** none
**Register:** 1 — pure/golden, in-process, no cluster (§K).

**Gate:** The reifiable `Model` explorer (`interpret` plus the in-process bounded-reachability checker) and
the `emitTLA` renderer round-trip a single small transition-system model — the in-process explorer and TLC
(run through the standard `tla2tools` toolchain over the freshly emitted `.tla`/`.cfg`) reach the *identical*
safety verdict on the correct model, **both** go red under one seeded safety mutation, TLC proves the model's
liveness `PROPERTY` under weak fairness and reports it red both with fairness removed and under a
liveness-breaking variant, and a QuickCheck generator over the fragment finds no explorer/TLC disagreement
across random small models — while the emitted `.tla`/`.cfg` are rendered fresh from the committed `Model`
source and are **never committed** to the repository. The run emits a Register-1 proven-for-the-model ledger
(liveness proven only under the assumed fairness); it establishes that the two renderings agree, not that any
cluster enforces anything.

## Doctrine adopted

- [`formal_model_doctrine.md §2`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#2-the-model-is-data) — the
  **`Model` is data**: a bounded transition system in a closed first-order fragment (booleans, arithmetic
  comparison, finite sets, finite quantifiers, function literals/update/application) whose transition relation
  is *reified* so it can be walked structurally rather than run as an opaque Haskell function.
- [`formal_model_doctrine.md §3`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#3-two-total-renderings) —
  **two total renderings**: `interpret` as the runtime decision core and `emitTLA` as the structural emitter,
  the only two consumers of the fragment, each a faithful denotation of every constructor.
- [`formal_model_doctrine.md §4`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#4-correspondence-by-construction)
  — **correspondence by construction**: a validated model is one where the in-process explorer and TLC agree
  on the correct model *and* both go red under the same seeded mutation — agreement plus shared fault
  sensitivity, in place of a hand-maintained variable→code correspondence table.
- [`formal_model_doctrine.md §5`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#5-the-tlacfg-are-generated-never-committed)
  — the **`.tla`/`.cfg` are generated, never committed**: emitted by an `amoebius` subcommand, stamped
  generated, regenerated from the current `Model` at every check.
- [`formal_model_doctrine.md §6`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#6-what-a-green-model-check-proves-and-what-it-does-not)
  — **what a green model-check proves, and what it does not**: proven-for-the-model at the declared bound, not
  a general-scope proof and not a proof the model is the right one; the honest ledger token this phase emits.
- [`generated_artifacts_doctrine.md §2`](../documents/engineering/generated_artifacts_doctrine.md#2-what-is-generated-and-from-what)
  and [`§3`](../documents/engineering/generated_artifacts_doctrine.md#3-the-rule) — **what is generated and the
  rule**: the `emitTLA` row of the generated-artifacts table, stamped generated and emitted by a subcommand,
  with a golden test pinning the *renderer's* behaviour rather than committing the artifact.

## Sprints

## Sprint 2.1: The `Model` fragment EDSL (the reifiable value) 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `src/Amoebius/Formal/Model.hs` (the `Model`/`Action`/`Expr` fragment types), a
`formal-model` cabal library + `formal-spec` test-suite stanza — target paths, not yet built.
**Blocked by**: Phase 1 gate (the toolchain spike records the pinned GHC/Cabal build).
**Independent Validation**: the fragment types compile under the pinned GHC 9.12.4 / Cabal 3.16.1.0; a
hand-authored small model (`ToyModel`) is expressible entirely inside the fragment with no opaque Haskell
function in its transition relation.
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md` (Phase-2 status backlink),
`DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system_components.md` (register `src/Amoebius/Formal/Model.hs`).

### Objective
Adopt [`formal_model_doctrine.md §2 — the Model is data`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#2-the-model-is-data):
define the closed, first-order, side-effect-free EDSL — `Model` (name, constants, vars, init, actions,
invariants, optional constraint), `Action` (guarded, parameterized, primed-effect), and the `Expr` fragment —
so that a modelled protocol is a *value that can be walked structurally*, which is the precondition for
emitting faithful TLA+ rather than hand-writing it.

### Deliverables
- `data Model`, `data Action`, and the `Expr` fragment carrying only booleans, arithmetic comparison, finite
  sets, quantifiers over finite sets, and function literal/update/application — and no more; plus the closed
  liveness pieces `data Fairness = WeakFair | StrongFair` and `data Temporal = Always Expr | Eventually Expr |
  LeadsTo Expr Expr`, carried by the `modelFairness`/`modelProperties` fields
  ([`formal_model_doctrine.md §2`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#2-the-model-is-data)).
- A worked small model (`ToyModel` — e.g. a bounded two-process mutual exclusion) authored purely inside the
  fragment, carrying at least one named safety invariant, a bounding constraint, and — under a weak-fairness
  annotation — at least one liveness property (e.g. *each process eventually enters its critical section*).

### Validation
1. The fragment types and `ToyModel` compile on the pinned toolchain; `ToyModel`'s transition relation is
   fully reified (a value in the fragment, not an opaque function) — checked by construction.

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned).

## Sprint 2.2: `interpret` + the in-process reachability explorer 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `src/Amoebius/Formal/Interpret.hs` (`interpret`), `src/Amoebius/Formal/Explore.hs` (the
bounded breadth-first reachability checker), `test/formal/ExploreSpec.hs` — target paths, not yet built.
**Blocked by**: Sprint 2.1.
**Independent Validation**: `interpret` computes the next state for a hand-checked (event, state) pair; the
explorer visits exactly the reachable-state set of `ToyModel` under its constraint and reports every invariant
on every reachable state — a `cabal test`, no cluster.
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md` (§3/§4 backlink),
`DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system_components.md`.

### Objective
Adopt [`formal_model_doctrine.md §3 — two total renderings`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#3-two-total-renderings):
build `interpret :: Model -> (Event -> State -> State)`, the pure runtime decision core, and the in-process
bounded-reachability explorer that mirrors TLC — breadth-first over reachable states, pruned by the model's
constraint, checking every invariant on every reachable state.

### Deliverables
- `interpret`, a total function from a `Model` to an `Event -> State -> State` step, unit-tested against
  hand-computed transitions.
- A bounded reachability explorer that returns the reachable-state count and the first invariant violation (if
  any), matching in shape the whole-state-space search TLC applies to the emitted spec.

### Validation
1. `interpret` reproduces hand-checked transitions; the explorer's reachable-state count and green/red verdict
   on `ToyModel` match the hand-derived expectation — **proven for the model** at the declared bound.

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned).

## Sprint 2.3: `emitTLA` renderer + never-committed emission 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `src/Amoebius/Formal/EmitTLA.hs` (`emitTLA`), `src/Amoebius/Cli/Formal.hs` (the
`amoebius dev model emit`/`check` subcommand), `test/formal/EmitGoldenSpec.hs`; emitted output lands in an
ignored build dir (`.build/spec/tla/`) — target paths, not yet built.
**Blocked by**: Sprint 2.1.
**Independent Validation**: `emitTLA ToyModel` renders a `.tla` + `.cfg`; the renderer is byte-for-byte
golden-locked; the emitted artifact carries a `-- GENERATED … do not edit by hand` stamp and is written only
to an ignored build path (a repository grep finds no committed `*.tla`/`*.cfg`).
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md` (§5 backlink),
`documents/engineering/generated_artifacts_doctrine.md` (the `emitTLA` row → built by Phase 2),
`DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system_components.md`.

### Objective
Adopt [`formal_model_doctrine.md §3`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#3-two-total-renderings)
and [`§5 — generated, never committed`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#5-the-tlacfg-are-generated-never-committed),
with [`generated_artifacts_doctrine.md §3 — the rule`](../documents/engineering/generated_artifacts_doctrine.md#3-the-rule):
build `emitTLA :: Model -> (Tla, Cfg)` as a structural walk of the fragment — state variables become
`VARIABLES`, the initial assignment becomes `Init`, each action an operator, their disjunction `Next`,
invariants named operators listed as `INVARIANT`s in the `.cfg`, the constraint a `CONSTRAINT`, each
`modelFairness` entry a `WF_vars`/`SF_vars` conjunct on the temporal `Spec`, and each `modelProperties` entry a
named temporal operator listed as a `PROPERTY` — emitted by an `amoebius` subcommand, stamped generated, and
never committed.

### Deliverables
- `emitTLA`, a total renderer, with the structural mapping above — safety (`INVARIANT`), the fairness-annotated
  `Spec`, and liveness (`PROPERTY`).
- An `amoebius dev model` subcommand that emits the `.tla`/`.cfg` fresh into an ignored build directory with a
  generated-by header; no `.tla`/`.cfg` is added to version control.
- A Register-1 golden test pinning the *renderer's* byte-for-byte output — the golden is a fixture of the
  renderer, not a committed spec.

### Validation
1. `emitTLA ToyModel` is byte-for-byte golden-locked; the emitted files appear only under the ignored build
   path and carry the generated stamp; a repository scan confirms no committed generated `.tla`/`.cfg`.

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned).

## Sprint 2.4: Round-trip + correspondence-by-construction on `ToyModel` 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `test/formal/RoundTripSpec.hs` (drives the explorer and TLC over the same `Model`), a
`tla2tools` invocation wrapper, a seeded-mutation variant of `ToyModel` — target paths, not yet built.
**Blocked by**: Sprint 2.2, Sprint 2.3.
**Independent Validation**: on the correct `ToyModel` the in-process explorer and TLC (over the freshly
emitted spec, via the version-stable JVM `tla2tools` toolchain) reach the identical **safety** verdict (same
reachable-state count, no counterexample); on one seeded safety mutation **both** report the same reachable
illegal state; TLC proves the `ToyModel` liveness `PROPERTY` under weak fairness and that same property goes
**red** with the fairness annotation removed (the fairness-sensitivity check); and a QuickCheck generator over
the `Model` fragment finds no random small model on which the explorer and TLC disagree (identical verdict +
reachable-state count — the differential faithfulness test).
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md` (§4/§6 — the correspondence + honesty
ledger this gate emits), `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md` (flip the Phase-2 status when the gate passes),
`DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/substrates.md` (the Phase-2 `none` gate row).

### Objective
Adopt [`formal_model_doctrine.md §4 — correspondence by construction`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#4-correspondence-by-construction)
and [`§6 — what a green model-check proves`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#6-what-a-green-model-check-proves-and-what-it-does-not):
validate the kernel by running *both* readings of the same `Model` — the in-process explorer and TLC on the
emitted spec — and require agreement on the correct model plus shared sensitivity to one seeded fault, the
operational form of "the two renderings mean the same thing."

### Deliverables
- A round-trip harness that: emits `ToyModel` to `.tla`/`.cfg`, runs TLC through `tla2tools`, runs the
  in-process explorer, and asserts identical safety verdicts; and drives TLC on the liveness `PROPERTY` under
  fairness (green) and with fairness removed (red).
- A deliberately broken `ToyModel'` (a mutated guard or effect that reaches the illegal state) that **both**
  checkers catch, plus a **liveness-breaking** variant (a stall/livelock that safety misses) that TLC's
  `PROPERTY` catches — showing liveness adds fault-detection safety alone lacks.
- A **differential faithfulness** property test: a QuickCheck generator over the `Model` fragment runs the
  explorer and TLC on random small models and asserts identical verdicts + reachable-state counts, shrinking any
  divergence to a minimal offending model
  ([`formal_model_doctrine.md §4`](../documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md#4-correspondence-by-construction)).
- The Register-1 proven-for-the-model ledger token, carrying the honest caveats of §6 (bounded scope; not a
  general-scope proof; not a proof the model is the right model; liveness proven only under the assumed
  fairness).

### Validation
1. Explorer and TLC agree (same reachable-state count, no counterexample) on the correct `ToyModel`; both go
   red on the seeded safety mutation; TLC proves the liveness `PROPERTY` under fairness and reports it red with
   fairness removed and on the liveness-breaking variant; the differential generator finds no
   explorer/TLC disagreement — the round-trip closes and the kernel is validated for the model at scope.

### Remaining Work
The whole sprint (📋 Planned). This sprint carries the phase gate.

## Documentation Requirements

**Engineering docs to update:**
- `documents/engineering/formal_model_doctrine.md` — backlink §2/§3/§4/§5/§6 to the Phase-2 kernel that
  realizes them; the round-trip claim moves from spike evidence (§7) to a built, Register-1-validated
  amoebius result on `ToyModel` when the gate runs.
- `documents/engineering/generated_artifacts_doctrine.md` — mark the `emitTLA` row's renderer as built by
  Phase 2 and note the golden-locked, never-committed emission.
- `documents/engineering/conformance_harness_doctrine.md` — record the Register-1 in-process explorer + TLC
  pairing as an instance of the "rendering never touches live infrastructure" invariant.

**Cross-references to add:**
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md` — flip the Phase-2 status when the gate passes; link this document.
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/substrates.md` — the Phase-2 `none` gate row.
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system_components.md` — register `src/Amoebius/Formal/{Model,Interpret,Explore,EmitTLA}.hs`
  and `src/Amoebius/Cli/Formal.hs` as Phase-2 design-first rows.
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/phase_03_gateway_migration_model.md` — backlink: the gateway-migration `Model` is authored
  on this kernel; only the kernel and its `ToyModel` round-trip are proven here.
