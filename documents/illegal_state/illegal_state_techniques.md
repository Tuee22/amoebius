## 1. Scope

This document is the **techniques** slice of the illegal-state catalog. It owns the seven reusable typing
techniques ([§4](#4-the-typing-techniques)), the coverage matrix ([§5](#5-coverage-matrix--which-technique-forecloses-which-illegal-state)),
the three-layer foreclosure model ([§6](#6-three-layers-of-foreclosure-and-the-honesty-they-force)), and — new in
this doc — the **validation-locus axis** (defined in [§6](#6-three-layers-of-foreclosure-and-the-honesty-they-force))
that classifies each illegal state by *where in the pipeline it is caught*, orthogonally to the foreclosure layer.

The **catalog index** — the enumerated `### 3.x` illegal-state entries themselves — and the load-bearing honesty
limit (a type-check proves the *spec composes*, not that the *running cluster enforces it*) are owned by
[`illegal_state_catalog.md`](./illegal_state_catalog.md); this document *references* them and does **not** restate
them. The DSL surface and the contract "a valid spec cannot represent illegal state" are owned by
[`dsl_doctrine.md`](../engineering/dsl_doctrine.md); the *normative rule* behind each catalog entry lives in that entry's owning
doctrine (storage, gateway/ingress, secrets, capacity, topology, …), named — never restated — where the techniques
below cite it.

Everything here is **design intent**, not a tested amoebius result: the type discipline it describes (the spec
composes; no illegal value is constructible) is a **Tier-1** (design-time / in-process) property targeted for
in-process validation in the **pre-cluster gates (Phases 4–7)** (Dhall Gate 1 `dhall type` + the Haskell decoder Gate 2 + QuickCheck), while
its **runtime enforcement** remains **Phase 20** (Tier 2). Status and gates live only in
[`../../DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md`](../../DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md).

---

## 4. The typing techniques

The catalog is foreclosed by seven reusable techniques operating across **two type layers**:

- **The Dhall layer** gives totality, sum types (unions), required fields, and a DSL prelude of *smart
  constructors* — functions that only ever produce valid values, so the user composes from a vocabulary
  with no illegal words. (The DSL surface is owned by [`dsl_doctrine.md`](../engineering/dsl_doctrine.md).)
- **The Haskell layer** (GHC 9.12.4; pin owned by
  [`../../DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md`](../../DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md)) decodes that value into
  **GADT-indexed** types carrying phantom tags and ownership indices, so the in-memory IR the interpreter
  walks has the same illegal-states-absent property as the spec it came from.

The seven techniques follow. Each leads with the principle, then the mechanism. Techniques [§4.6](#46-capacity-accounting--placement-witness-compute-and-summed-demand-within-capacity-storage-checked) and [§4.7](#47-compatibility--topology-relations-by-construction-over-a-collection) were
added for the capacity / topology / bounded-storage block ([§3.13](./illegal_state_topology.md#313-a-compute-engine-incompatible-with-its-substrates-managed-providers-first-class)–[§3.22](./illegal_state_capacity.md#322-a-hand-authored-un-derived-toleration)); [§4.6](#46-capacity-accounting--placement-witness-compute-and-summed-demand-within-capacity-storage-checked) is the one technique that is
**irreducibly decode-foreclosed** ([§2](./illegal_state_catalog.md#2-the-load-bearing-limit-a-type-check-proves-the-spec-composes-not-that-the-cluster-enforces-it), [§6](#6-three-layers-of-foreclosure-and-the-honesty-they-force)).

### 4.1 PVC↔PV binding by construction

*Principle:* don't declare two things and hope they match — declare **one** thing that emits the matched
pair. *Mechanism:* a single `BoundVolume` smart constructor takes one size (a refined non-zero quantity)
and emits *both* the StatefulSet claim request *and* the exactly-matching `no-provisioner` PV, sharing size
and access mode, named `<namespace>/<statefulset>/pv_<integer>`. There is no constructor for a bare PVC and
none for a free-floating PV, so [§3.1](./illegal_state_storage.md#31-bad--illegal-durable-storage) and [§3.2](./illegal_state_storage.md#32-pvcs-that-dont-bind-pvs) have no inhabitants. The *binding* is the value. The retain,
sizing, and deterministic-rebind rules are owned by
[`storage_lifecycle_doctrine.md`](../engineering/storage_lifecycle_doctrine.md); this doc owns only the
*pairing-by-construction* technique.

### 4.2 Capability and phantom tenant tags — cross-tenant refs are uninhabitable

*Principle:* the right to do or reference a thing is a *token that must be held*, and the tenant a reference
belongs to is *baked into its type* — so the dangerous operation is not "discouraged," it is *unconstructable*
by anyone without the token. *Mechanism:* a reference is `Ref tenant a`, phantom-tagged by a tenant index;
the only constructors that produce a `Ref t a` demand a capability scoped to `t`, and crucially **there is
no function `Ref t1 a -> Ref t2 a`**. A child spec is decoded under its own tenant tag, so it cannot even
*name* a sibling's resources ([§3.8](./illegal_state_security.md#38-cross-tenant-references-and-literal-secrets)). The same shape forecloses [§3.7](./illegal_state_security.md#37-accidental-insecure--backdoor-ingress): only the Keycloak edge holds the
`ExposeToWild` capability, so no app-authored value can produce a wild endpoint. This is the type-level form
of the locked rules "secrets are names only / parents inject into child Vault" and "Keycloak owns all wild
ingress."

### 4.3 GADT-indexed state machines — only legal transitions are typed

*Principle:* a thing that moves through phases (a volume that is `Unbound` then `Bound`; an endpoint that is
host-local vs wild; a route that needs a live backend) should make the *illegal* transition simply have no
constructor. *Mechanism:* a GADT indexed by phase, where each operation's type names its precondition phase
and its postcondition phase. An operation that requires a `Bound` volume cannot be applied to an `Unbound`
one; a wild route can only be built *from* a constructed service handle, so [§3.3](./illegal_state_security.md#33-misconfigured-gateway)'s "route to a non-existent
backend" and [§3.6](./illegal_state_security.md#36-blocking-networkpolicy-services-cant-reach-each-other)'s "consumer with no provider" cannot be written; endpoint kinds (`WildIngress` vs
`HostLocalPeer`, [§3.7](./illegal_state_security.md#37-accidental-insecure--backdoor-ingress)) are distinct indices that do not interconvert. The illegal transition is not rejected
at runtime — it was never a value. The same distinct-index discipline carries the stretched-cluster wires added
this round: a `SecureGatewayReach` (the authenticated secure-gateway arm of `Networking = Gateway | Vpn`) is a
distinct endpoint index with **no** constructor into `WildIngress` ([§3.40](./illegal_state_security.md#340-a-secure-gateway-reach-collapsing-into-wild-ingress)),
and a stretched node's `Reach` sum is kind-indexed so a host worker has no constructor into the control-plane
witness ([§3.38](./illegal_state_multicluster.md#338-a-host-worker-granted-a-control-plane-witness-or-treated-as-a-member)).

### 4.4 Ownership indices — single-owner SSoT, structurally

*Principle:* every resource has **exactly one** owner; "two owners" and "no owner" should both be impossible,
because shared ownership is how SSoT rots. *Mechanism:* resources are aggregated through an *ownership index*
— building the cluster IR is a total fold from resource to its single owner. A node-inventory owns "which
substrates exist" (so [§3.5](./illegal_state_capacity.md#35-undeployable-pods-taints-tolerations--affinity)'s unmatchable affinity is caught against one authoritative list), and the declared
dependency graph owns connectivity (so [§3.6](./illegal_state_security.md#36-blocking-networkpolicy-services-cant-reach-each-other)'s NetworkPolicies are *derived*, never hand-authored). Where the
index is type-level (distinct owner keys), a double-claim fails to type-check; where it is value-level, the
fold is a **total decode-time check** that rejects a duplicate or missing owner. (That distinction is exactly
the [§6](#6-three-layers-of-foreclosure-and-the-honesty-they-force) honesty layer — amoebius does not pretend a decode-time check is a type-inhabitance proof.) This is the
amoebius generalization of the prodbox single-owner SSoT discipline, lifted into the type/decode layer.

### 4.5 Content-address totality — names are total functions of content

*Principle:* a name that doesn't correspond to a real thing is the root of dangling pointers, wrong-IP DNS,
and stale image refs — so make the name a *computed function of the content*, never a free string an operator
types. *Mechanism:* `contentAddress :: Manifest -> Digest` is a total pure function; the only way to obtain a
reference is to hash an actual artifact, so a dangling reference has no inhabitant. Applied to DNS ([§3.4](./illegal_state_security.md#34-dns-that-binds-to-the-wrong-ip)): a
name binds to an *allocated LB address* computed from the realized service, not a typed IP, so "DNS bound to
the wrong/unowned IP" cannot be expressed. The content-addressed MinIO store (pointers → manifests → blobs)
and the `experimentHash` identity are owned by
[`content_addressing_doctrine.md`](../engineering/content_addressing_doctrine.md); this doc owns only the *totality
technique* — names are derived, never asserted.

### 4.6 Capacity accounting — placement witness (compute) and summed demand within capacity (storage), checked

*Principle:* an aggregate `Σ demand ≤ Σ capacity` is **necessary but not sufficient** for compute — pods are
**atomic and cannot straddle nodes**, so a set can fit in aggregate yet leave a single pod that fits no node
(3×4-CPU nodes admit a 5-CPU pod by the sum; it is `Pending` forever). So the compute check is a **placement**,
not a sum, while genuinely divisible storage/retention stays a `Σ`. *Mechanism:* two shapes selected by
topology ([`resource_capacity_doctrine.md §4.1`](../engineering/resource_capacity_doctrine.md#41-place-branches-static-proves-a-placement-dynamic-proves-a-growth-envelope)):
a **fixed** node set → a first-fit-decreasing **witness bin-pack** honoring per-node allocatable, affinity/taints
(`podFits`), and anti-affinity, returning a concrete `Placement` or `Left Unschedulable`; an **elastic** node
set → a **two-envelope** check (each pod fits the largest candidate instance; Σ at max scale ≤ quota) the
autoscaler can always satisfy. Single-owner *carves* below the cluster (VM out of host) stay pure subtractions;
storage is `Σ(sizes) ≤ backing`. It nests — host → VM → guest, **host → host-worker** (a native accelerator
subprocess folded against its physical-host `Capacity`, [§3.29](./illegal_state_capacity.md#329-a-host-worker-whose-demand-overflows-its-physical-host)),
cluster → workload, and **accelerator-worker → served-model** (a `Σ served-model VRAM ≤ node vram` sub-budget the
wholesale accelerator owner carves, [§3.30](./illegal_state_capacity.md#330-a-served-model-whose-vram-footprint-exceeds-node-vram)) — and **re-runs** after any
[§4.2](#42-capability-and-phantom-tenant-tags--cross-tenant-refs-are-uninhabitable) `Growable` policy grows the
bound. Distinct from [§4.4](#44-ownership-indices--single-owner-ssot-structurally) (which checks
single-ownership, not arithmetic). **Honesty:** this technique is **irreducibly decode-foreclosed** — Dhall has no
dependent arithmetic, so both "a feasible packing exists" and `Σ ≤ cap` are *checked rejections of a
constructible value*, never an absence of inhabitants; any entry claiming a capacity/storage/retention check is
type-foreclosed is dishonest. The compute bin-pack is additionally **sound-not-complete** (NP-hard, so a heuristic
that may false-reject a packable spec but never admits an unplaceable one); the storage `Σ` carries no such
caveat. The model (`Capacity`/`Demand`/`Budget`, `podFits`/`place`, the static-vs-elastic branch, the
`StorageBudget` and `Growable` unions, the two-ceiling Pulsar fold, and the declared-vs-probed *allocatable*
cross-check) is owned by [`resource_capacity_doctrine.md`](../engineering/resource_capacity_doctrine.md); this doc owns only
the *technique*. Forecloses [§3.17](./illegal_state_capacity.md#317-an-over-committed-deploy-or-workload-host--vm--cluster-capacity-exceeded)–[§3.21](./illegal_state_storage.md#321-capacity-growth-without-an-amoebius-owned-scaling-policy), [§3.27](./illegal_state_capacity.md#327-a-schedulable-in-aggregate-but-unplaceable-workload-atomic-pod--gpu-bin-packing), and this round's [§3.29](./illegal_state_capacity.md#329-a-host-worker-whose-demand-overflows-its-physical-host)–[§3.30](./illegal_state_capacity.md#330-a-served-model-whose-vram-footprint-exceeds-node-vram) (the host→host-worker and accelerator-worker→served-model arms).

### 4.7 Compatibility / topology relations by construction over a collection

*Principle:* a cluster is not a bag of settings — it is a *collection of nodes*, and "which engine may sit on
which substrate" is a *relation* that should have no illegal pair. *Mechanism:* a `Topology` is a fold over a
`NonEmpty Node`; only a compatible `(engine, substrate-indexed LinuxHost | hostless Provider)` pair has a
constructor ([§4.3](#43-gadt-indexed-state-machines--only-legal-transitions-are-typed) gating + [§4.2](#42-capability-and-phantom-tenant-tags--cross-tenant-refs-are-uninhabitable) phantom index), and the cluster-wide check is a **total elementwise fold**
([§4.4](#44-ownership-indices--single-owner-ssot-structurally)) that returns the full list of incompatible nodes. Because it is elementwise, a **heterogeneous
multi-substrate cluster stays legal** while an incompatible pairing has no inhabitant. Cardinality (`node ==
host` list length) is type-foreclosed by construction; distinctness ("one host per node, no reuse") is the part
Dhall cannot express as a type and degrades to a decode-foreclosed fold. This composes [§4.2](#42-capability-and-phantom-tenant-tags--cross-tenant-refs-are-uninhabitable)/[§4.3](#43-gadt-indexed-state-machines--only-legal-transitions-are-typed)/[§4.4](#44-ownership-indices--single-owner-ssot-structurally) applied to a
**binary relation over a collection**, and reads the single node inventory owned by
[`substrate_doctrine.md`](../engineering/substrate_doctrine.md). The types are owned by
[`cluster_topology_doctrine.md`](../engineering/cluster_topology_doctrine.md); this doc owns the *relation technique*. The
same **binary-relation-over-a-collection** shape covers the **model↔engine** relation ([§3.25](./illegal_state_ml_asset.md#325-an-ml-asset-named-by-arbitrary-url-or-an-unready--unlanded-model)): a `ModelArtifact`
is servable only by an `EngineRuntime` present on the **serving substrate lane** (where inference runs, not where
the model was produced), so an unmatched model has no landing engine — a decode-foreclosed total fold exactly like
the engine↔substrate check, owned by
[`content_addressing_doctrine.md`](../engineering/content_addressing_doctrine.md) and
[`service_capability_doctrine.md`](../engineering/service_capability_doctrine.md). And the rke2 **server/agent** inventory
([§3.24](./illegal_state_topology.md#324-an-evenzero-server-rke2-control-plane-no-etcd-quorum--split-brain), [§3.16](./illegal_state_topology.md#316-a-multi-node-rke2-cluster-with-fewer-linux-hosts-than-nodes-or-a-host-reused)) is this same collection shape with a *closed-cardinality* server set (`Rke2Servers`, type-foreclosed)
plus a variable `agents` list whose host-distinctness runs over `servers ∪ agents` (a decode-foreclosed fold).
This round extends the same **relation-over-a-collection** shape to two further collections. **(i)** The
**wholesale accelerator owner** is a per-node ownership index ([§4.4](#44-ownership-indices--single-owner-ssot-structurally))
over the node's accelerators, so two owners on one node or a per-pod fractional claim has no inhabitant
([§3.28](./illegal_state_capacity.md#328-two-accelerator-owners-on-one-node-or-a-fractional-accelerator-claim)). **(ii)** A **stretched
cluster** is one `Topology` whose `NonEmpty Node` (and a parallel host-worker inventory) span two `Site`s: a
**total `Site` fold over each collection** classifies stretchedness and routes a declared-remote entity to a
demanding constructor — the node fold to `mkStretchedAgent` (minting `ReachesControlPlane c`,
[§3.36](./illegal_state_multicluster.md#336-a-declared-remote-full-agent-with-no-control-plane-witness)) and the host-worker-inventory fold to
the attach carrier (minting `FabricMember c`, [§3.35](./illegal_state_multicluster.md#335-a-stretched-host-worker-with-no-declared-networking-capability))
— with a per-kind `witness` dispatch whose uninhabited cells (a host worker as a member
[§3.38](./illegal_state_multicluster.md#338-a-host-worker-granted-a-control-plane-witness-or-treated-as-a-member), a full node on a managed EKS
control plane [§3.37](./illegal_state_topology.md#337-a-full-stretched-node-on-a-managed-eks-control-plane-without-a-provider-native-hybrid-arm))
are the closed-union no-arm idiom, and a `Site`-indexed `Rke2Servers (s)` forcing a co-located etcd quorum
([§3.39](./illegal_state_topology.md#339-a-split-site-etcd-quorum)). Folding such a cluster's capacity as *two* `Topology`s is the
[§3.31](./illegal_state_multicluster.md#331-a-capacity-or-workload-fold-spanning-two-clusters) cross-cluster fold that has no constructor.
Forecloses [§3.13](./illegal_state_topology.md#313-a-compute-engine-incompatible-with-its-substrates-managed-providers-first-class)–[§3.16](./illegal_state_topology.md#316-a-multi-node-rke2-cluster-with-fewer-linux-hosts-than-nodes-or-a-host-reused), [§3.24](./illegal_state_topology.md#324-an-evenzero-server-rke2-control-plane-no-etcd-quorum--split-brain), and the model↔engine relation of [§3.25](./illegal_state_ml_asset.md#325-an-ml-asset-named-by-arbitrary-url-or-an-unready--unlanded-model).

## 6. Three layers of foreclosure (and the honesty they force)

Not every entry above is foreclosed the *same* way, and saying otherwise would violate the
proven/tested/assumed discipline ([`documentation_standards.md` §6](../documentation_standards.md#6-honesty-the-proventestedassumed-discipline)). There
are three layers, and a conformant claim names which one it is reaching:

1. **`type-foreclosed` — uninhabitable by type.** The illegal value has *no constructor* — the strongest layer. A cross-tenant
   reference ([§3.8](./illegal_state_security.md#38-cross-tenant-references-and-literal-secrets)) and a bare PVC ([§3.2](./illegal_state_storage.md#32-pvcs-that-dont-bind-pvs)) are meant to live here. The "proof" is type-inhabitance, checked
   by Dhall + GHC at the spec/code layer.
2. **`decode-foreclosed` — rejected by total decode-time check.** A looser type *can* hold the value, but a **total** smart
   constructor or fold rejects it during decode (e.g. a value-level ownership double-claim, [§4.4](#44-ownership-indices--single-owner-ssot-structurally); a size
   that fails its refinement). This is still a *spec-layer* guarantee — the spec never reaches the
   interpreter — but it is a *checked rejection*, not an absence of inhabitants. Call it that.
3. **`runtime-checked` — enforced only at reconcile/runtime.** Some invariants (whether the LB actually comes up, whether the pod
   actually schedules, whether two clusters converge after a partition) cannot be settled by inspecting the
   spec at all. These are **not** in this catalog's promise; their verification is owned by
   [`chaos_failover_doctrine.md`](../engineering/chaos_failover_doctrine.md) and the testing doctrine ([§2](./illegal_state_catalog.md#2-the-load-bearing-limit-a-type-check-proves-the-spec-composes-not-that-the-cluster-enforces-it)).

**The two-tier mapping.** Layers 1–2 (`type-foreclosed` + `decode-foreclosed`) are the **Tier-1** design-time /
in-process integrity band — the spec composes and the type discipline holds in the abstract — validated
**in-process in the pre-cluster gates (Phases 4–7)** (Dhall Gate 1 `dhall type`, the Haskell decoder Gate 2, and QuickCheck). Layer 3
(`runtime-checked`) is **Tier-2** runtime-enforcement integrity — that the running cluster enforces what the spec
composed — and stays **deferred and UNVERIFIED** until its live real-resource phase (owned by
[`chaos_failover_doctrine.md`](../engineering/chaos_failover_doctrine.md) and the testing doctrine).

**Gate-1 vs Gate-2 caveat (Dhall has no opaque types).** The binding-by-construction and phantom-index / GADT
foreclosures ([§4.1](#41-pvcpv-binding-by-construction)–[§4.3](#43-gadt-indexed-state-machines--only-legal-transitions-are-typed))
are only **partially** `type-foreclosed` at Gate 1: Dhall has no opaque types, so it cannot hide a record's or
union's constructors, and the full "no illegal constructor" teeth land only at the Haskell **GADT** decoder (Gate 2,
`Dhall.inputFile`). So the Phase-6 corpus must **split** its negative fixtures into *Gate-1-must-fail-`dhall type`*
(illegal already at the Dhall layer) and *Gate-2-must-fail-decode* (well-typed Dhall the decoder rejects), and never
bill a Gate-2-only foreclosure as a Gate-1 type-check failure.

Worked example of the discipline: **every container declares cpu/ram**
([`platform_services_doctrine.md` §10](../engineering/platform_services_doctrine.md#10-every-container-declares-cpu-and-ram)). As specified, a workload value
*requires* a `Resources` field whose cpu and ram are refined non-zero quantities — type- or decode-foreclosed: a
container with no resources is unrepresentable / rejected at decode. What the catalog does **not** claim is
that the *running* pod's cgroup limits are honored by the kernel — that is runtime-checked, and amoebius does not
assert it here. Stating the layer is what separates "illegal state is impossible" as an unqualified claim from
a defensible boundary.

Second worked example, the one the [§3.13](./illegal_state_topology.md#313-a-compute-engine-incompatible-with-its-substrates-managed-providers-first-class)–[§3.22](./illegal_state_capacity.md#322-a-hand-authored-un-derived-toleration) block turns on: **capacity sums are the canonical decode-foreclosed
case, and saying otherwise is dishonest.** `Σ demand ≤ capacity` ([§3.17](./illegal_state_capacity.md#317-an-over-committed-deploy-or-workload-host--vm--cluster-capacity-exceeded)), `Σ(PV caps) ≤ backing` ([§3.18](./illegal_state_storage.md#318-unbounded-storage-anywhere)),
the store-size fold ([§3.19](./illegal_state_storage.md#319-an-application-consuming-more-storage-than-its-backing-minio-and-pulsar)), the Pulsar room-fit ([§3.20](./illegal_state_storage.md#320-a-pulsar-topic-without-a-bounded--tiered--retained-lifecycle)), and the rke2 host-distinctness check ([§3.16](./illegal_state_topology.md#316-a-multi-node-rke2-cluster-with-fewer-linux-hosts-than-nodes-or-a-host-reused)) are
all **total decode-time rejections of constructible values** — because capacity is a *value*, not a type
index, and Dhall has no dependent arithmetic to make `Σ ≤ cap` a statement about inhabitance ([§4.6](#46-capacity-accounting--placement-witness-compute-and-summed-demand-within-capacity-storage-checked)). By
contrast, the type-foreclosed "no constructor" examples are the topology *witnesses* ([§3.14](./illegal_state_topology.md#314-rke2kind-on-a-host-with-no-linux-node-applewindows-without-an-interposed-linux-vm) `LinuxHost`, [§3.15](./illegal_state_topology.md#315-a-multi-node-kind-cluster-not-on-a-single-linux-host)
one-host `Kind`), the *derived* toleration ([§3.22](./illegal_state_capacity.md#322-a-hand-authored-un-derived-toleration)), the mandatory-shape unions ([§3.20](./illegal_state_storage.md#320-a-pulsar-topic-without-a-bounded--tiered--retained-lifecycle) non-optional
`RetentionPolicy` + size offload, [§3.21](./illegal_state_storage.md#321-capacity-growth-without-an-amoebius-owned-scaling-policy) `Growable` with no unbounded arm), and the CBOR-only payload codec
([§3.23](./illegal_state_capability_messaging.md#323-a-non-cbor-pulsar-payload), whose *consume*-side decode is a decode-foreclosed total check like CRC32C). A single catalog entry may mix
layers ([§3.13](./illegal_state_topology.md#313-a-compute-engine-incompatible-with-its-substrates-managed-providers-first-class), [§3.16](./illegal_state_topology.md#316-a-multi-node-rke2-cluster-with-fewer-linux-hosts-than-nodes-or-a-host-reused), [§3.18](./illegal_state_storage.md#318-unbounded-storage-anywhere), [§3.20](./illegal_state_storage.md#320-a-pulsar-topic-without-a-bounded--tiered--retained-lifecycle)): it is then assigned to its **weaker layer**, and the split is stated in
the entry. And the physical residues — the host actually capping bytes/cgroups, the broker actually
offloading to S3, the pod actually scheduling, the Lima/WSL2 VM actually interposing, the autoscaler actually
growing capacity, and the cloud honoring the quota — are always runtime-checked, owned by
[`chaos_failover_doctrine.md`](../engineering/chaos_failover_doctrine.md) and the testing doctrine, never asserted here.

### 6.1 The validation-locus axis — where each illegal state is caught (orthogonal to the foreclosure layer)

The three foreclosure **layers** above classify *what kind of proof* forecloses an illegal state: type-inhabitance
(`type-foreclosed`), a total decode-time rejection (`decode-foreclosed`), or reconcile/runtime enforcement
(`runtime-checked`). A **second, orthogonal axis** — the **validation-locus** — classifies *where in the pipeline*
the illegal state is actually caught, i.e. the concrete gate at which a test would observe the rejection. The two
axes are independent: the *layer* answers "by what kind of check," the *locus* answers "at which stage a fixture
must fail." Every catalog entry names a **primary locus**, and almost every entry also names a **`live-effect`
residue** — the physical fact the spec-layer check structurally cannot settle. Each `### 3.x` entry in
[`illegal_state_catalog.md`](./illegal_state_catalog.md) carries a **`Validation-locus:`** line naming its loci,
derived from — but not identical to — its `Layer:` tag.

The four loci:

1. **`Gate-1-editor` — fails `dhall type` at authoring time.** The illegal spec is rejected by the Dhall
   type-checker *in the editor*, before any binary runs. This is where the **closed-union / no-arm**, **required-field**,
   and **`NonEmpty`** foreclosures surface — a product engine name ([§3.12](./illegal_state_capability_messaging.md#312-an-app-that-names-a-product-instead-of-a-capability)),
   an even/zero `Rke2Servers` arm ([§3.24](./illegal_state_topology.md#324-an-evenzero-server-rke2-control-plane-no-etcd-quorum--split-brain)),
   a workload missing its `Resources` field ([§3.11](./illegal_state_security.md#311-an-unsafe-workload-no-resource-limits-no-hardened-securitycontext)),
   an empty `extMonitoring` list ([§3.43](./illegal_state_lifecycle.md#343-an-unmonitored-workflow-or-extension-or-an-unauthenticated-monitoring-surface)).
   It is the editor-time face of the `type-foreclosed` layer — subject to the Gate-1-vs-Gate-2 caveat above (Dhall
   has no opaque types, so a foreclosure that *reads* as type-level may only fully bite at Gate 2).
2. **`Gate-2-decoder` — the total decoder returns `Left`.** Well-typed Dhall the Haskell **GADT** decoder or a
   **total fold** rejects at `Dhall.inputFile` time: the phantom-index / GADT constructor-gating whose teeth Dhall
   cannot express ([§4.1](#41-pvcpv-binding-by-construction)–[§4.3](#43-gadt-indexed-state-machines--only-legal-transitions-are-typed)),
   the **ownership-fold** double-/missing-owner rejection ([§4.4](#44-ownership-indices--single-owner-ssot-structurally)),
   and every **capacity / placement / retention fold** ([§4.6](#46-capacity-accounting--placement-witness-compute-and-summed-demand-within-capacity-storage-checked)).
   It is the decoder-time face of `decode-foreclosed`, and — because Dhall exposes constructors — also where the
   residual teeth of the [§4.1](#41-pvcpv-binding-by-construction)–[§4.3](#43-gadt-indexed-state-machines--only-legal-transitions-are-typed)
   `type-foreclosed` foreclosures actually land.
3. **`rendered-output-golden` — caught by a golden test on the rendered manifest, not a cluster.** Some invariants are
   properties of the **emitted objects**, observable after decode-and-render but before any apply: that every generated
   workload carries the **hardened securityContext** ([§3.11](./illegal_state_security.md#311-an-unsafe-workload-no-resource-limits-no-hardened-securitycontext)),
   that the **NetworkPolicy set derived** from the declared dependency graph matches those edges
   ([§3.6](./illegal_state_security.md#36-blocking-networkpolicy-services-cant-reach-each-other)), that **no emitted object opens a backdoor wild
   ingress** ([§3.7](./illegal_state_security.md#37-accidental-insecure--backdoor-ingress)). These are verified by a **golden test over the rendered
   manifest** — the "the generator only ever produces safe objects" claim, checked against the output artifact, never
   against a running cluster.
4. **`live-effect` — observable only at reconcile/runtime.** The `runtime-checked` residue: whether the LB comes up,
   the pod schedules, etcd forms and holds quorum, the Lima/WSL2 VM interposes, the autoscaler grows, the broker
   offloads to S3, the `drain-complete` edge is truthfully observed. **Not** in this catalog's promise; owned by
   [`chaos_failover_doctrine.md`](../engineering/chaos_failover_doctrine.md) and the testing doctrine.

Because the axes are orthogonal, a single entry commonly names several loci at once — e.g.
[§3.43](./illegal_state_lifecycle.md#343-an-unmonitored-workflow-or-extension-or-an-unauthenticated-monitoring-surface) is `Gate-1-editor` (the mandatory
monitor field, the absent `Off`/`Public` arms), `Gate-2-decoder` (the coverage / feasibility folds),
`rendered-output-golden` (the derived rules/panels in the emitted objects), and `live-effect` (that the alert actually
fires) — and the foreclosure *layer* of each part is stated separately in the entry. The loci also map loosely onto
the two-tier band: `Gate-1-editor`, `Gate-2-decoder`, and `rendered-output-golden` are **Tier-1** design-time /
in-process gates (validated in the **pre-cluster band, Phases 4–7**), while `live-effect` is the **Tier-2** runtime-enforcement residue
deferred to its live phase.

### 6.2 The enumeration limit — the catalog is enumerated, not proven exhaustive

The catalog is an **enumeration**, not a completeness proof. amoebius lists the illegal states it has identified and
names the technique that forecloses each; it does **not** prove that the list is *exhaustive*, because there is **no
denotational definition of "deployable"** against which exhaustiveness could be measured. "Deployable" is
characterized *extensionally* — by the enumerated set of states declared illegal and foreclosed — not *denotationally*
by a semantic predicate over all possible cluster states.

Consequently a green Gate-1 / Gate-2 pass proves two things and not a third: (a) a well-typed spec **composes** into
an internally coherent value, and (b) **each enumerated** illegal state is unrepresentable or decode-rejected. It does
**not** prove (c) that **every conceivable** unsafe cluster state has a catalog entry. New illegal states are added to
the catalog as they are identified; the honesty discipline ([§6](#6-three-layers-of-foreclosure-and-the-honesty-they-force),
[`documentation_standards.md` §6](../documentation_standards.md#6-honesty-the-proventestedassumed-discipline)) forbids reading
the enumeration as a closed proof of safety, just as it forbids reading a `type-foreclosed` claim as a statement
about the running cluster ([§2](./illegal_state_catalog.md#2-the-load-bearing-limit-a-type-check-proves-the-spec-composes-not-that-the-cluster-enforces-it)).
